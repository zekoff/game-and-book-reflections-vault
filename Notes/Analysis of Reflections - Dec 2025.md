# Goals of analysis:

- Find out what types of games tend to speak to me the most
- Potentially narrow down my future purchases to ones that have the highest chance of success
- Identify pivotal games in my design understanding or comparison/contrast usage
- Identify “outliers”
- Assess whether AAA versus indie, etc. games tend to have a higher hit chance with me
- Other trends that spring to mind

## Steps:

1. Scroll through table of contents and simply pull out games that particularly stand out: I remember them well for some reason, good or bad.
2. List of games I remember strongly liking
3. List of games I remember strongly disliking
4. Identify commonalities or trends
5. Tag games with things I see consistently of note to me as I think about them
# List of standouts that I liked

(including things I remember without going back to my write-ups)

- [[Star Ocean - The Second Story R]]

	1. JRPG
    
	2. The skill system: some skills were locked behind combinations of other skills, and many skills were not combat related at all
    
	3. Setting was interesting -- Science-Fantasy
    
	4. Liked it despite mundane characters and a forgettable overall story. Combat must have been at least engaging for me to have beaten it. That’s actually crazy -- I rarely beat games and I remember playing this one to completion.
    

- [[Terraformers]]
    

	1. Strategy / Grand Strategy
    
	2. My preferred Civilization game, strategy with some randomness, rewards making the best of what you have
    
	3. Optimistic worldview, little cynicism
    

- [[Worldless]]
    

	1. Metroidvania
    
	2. UI-less gameplay screen, fun abilities, difficult combat with excellent feedback
    
	3. Mostly memorable for its aesthetic but also for its character-switching which was useful both in combat and in exploration. And neat that the “evil” character is actually the other side of your coin and the real evil is something else.
    

- [[Game Reflections/Crystal Project]]
    

	1. JRPG
    
	2. Deep customization, mixing and matching of classes and abilities
    
	3. Unusual art style. 2D billboarded sprites moving around a 3D voxel world a la Minecraft
    
	4. Surprising amount of platforming. Very non-directed experience. Tradeoff is the sense of discovery but also the risk of not knowing how to progress. Ultimately I offboarded because I couldn’t tell where to go next.
    

- [[Prince of Persia - The Lost Crown]]
    

	1. Metroidvania
    
	2. Excellent combat, solid traversal options, phenomenal presentation.
    
	3. I don’t remember why, but I remember tearing up at the end of this game during the final boss fight or the epilogue.
    

- [[Unicorn Overlord]]
    

	1. Strategy / JRPG / RTS
    
	2. Incredible art, animation, voice acting. Best-in-class.
    
	3. Memorable voice lines. “Higher still.” “I’m just gettin’ started!”
    
	4. Pure story of good and evil. Mashup between political intrigue and world-stakes good and evil.
    
	5. Played to completion, over 100 hours. Satisfying ending.
    
	6. Bananas level of customization. Dozens of classes, each of which has at least one uniquely voiced and drawn character. Multiple gear slots, multiple abilities, free-form scripting of combat abilities, per character. Five characters per unit. Up to 12 units.
    
	7. Real-time with pause RTS stages
    
	8. Unique trait of battles between units being completely hands off. Script them and build the unit beforehand.
    
	9. I remember putting some units together not because they were optimal but because those characters would be together in the world of the game.
    
	10. Played on hard mode which forced real tactical thinking and full engagement with the game systems. Likely one of the reasons I saw it to completion.
    

- [[Hero’s Hour]]
    

	1. Strategy
    
	2. My favorite part is how different the playable nations are.
    
	3. Maximalist, kitchen-sink approach. Throw many systems in there.
    
	4. All hinges ultimately on combat power.
    
	5. Fun to put together different unit compositions but ultimately a game about moving your one or two death stacks around the map.
    
	6. Fun that you get to level your character and your towns (leading to better armies).
    
	7. I think this was inspired by “Heroes of Might and Magic” which by all accounts is another seminal work that I haven’t actually played.
    

- [[Imagine Earth]]
    

	1. Strategy / Grand Strategy
    
	2. Oddly, I don’t remember much about this game. Thematically in the vein of Terraformers just in the sense of having to colonize a planet.
    
	3. I think environmental impact was one of the mechanics.
    
	4. It had a slightly rickety Switch port.
    
	5. Tiles are triangles rather than hexes which was neat.
    
	6. Strange that it went on my list of standouts despite how little I remember about it.
    

- [[Shattered Pixel Dungeon]]
    

	1. Traditional Roguelike
    
	2. One of my go-to games for years.
    
	3. Class system is one of my favorite parts.
    
	4. It’s possibly the best traditional roguelike available. Written at length about it in the main section of the doc.
    

- [[Unciv]]
    

	1. Strategy / Grand Strategy
    
	2. It’s just a mobile version of Civ 5. Stands out because of how competent a Civ port it is on a mobile device.
    
	3. My sort of game in that it looks a little low-fidelity but makes up for it in smooth and rich gameplay. I’d rather have a snappy low-fi feel than a beautiful game that performs poorly or adds friction because it’s high on its own presentation.
    

- [[Grapple Dogs - Cosmic Canines]]
    

	1. Action Platformer
    
	2. Delightful specifically because of its central mechanic -- the grappling hook.
    
	3. Memorable partially in that the grapple is constrained to certain surfaces and yet it still feels very freeform. This is a testament to the level design.
    
	4. One of the few games where I’ve actually spent some time speed-running certain levels. Typically speed running gives me hives.
    
	5. Lighthearted dialogue that struck my funny bone.
    

- [[Metal Slug Tactics]]
    

	1. Tactics
    
	2. Loved the two central hooks: having units that are highly mobile, and rewarding sync attacks where multiple units attack the same enemy if positioned correctly.
    
	3. Another game which had a rickety Switch port. I’d have probably put even more time into it if it had been a smoother experience.
    

- [[Necrosmith]]
    

	1. Genre-blend: RTS / Idle / Autobattler
    
	2. Adored the central mechanic of building units from component parts and then releasing them to do things on their own.
    
	3. Liked the secondary system of being able to set blueprints for combinations that you like, and also the revelation of named unit types if you happen to assemble the right set.
    
	4. Hated the necromancy aesthetics (attempt at cartoony, but still bones and crap everywhere)
    

- [[Urbek City Builder]]
    

	1. City-builder (wha??)
    
	2. Smooth gameplay, feels fully at home on a console rather than mouse and keyboard.
    
	3. Unusual adjacency system where buildings grow based on what is within X tiles of them
    
	4. Suffered from optimal solutions. I got a mental blueprint or at least intuition of how to slap down districts that would become the highest-level. At the same time, there were other building types where I never could reliably figure out how to get them to appear. I forgive the game this because I had dozens of hours of fun before hitting this stage. I consider it having reached the point of breaking the game, a point at which most games suffer. Or rather, when you reach the breaking point, you find out whether this was the game you actually wanted to be playing or not.
    
	5. Really hinged on opportunity costs. For a game with stages of, say, 100x100 tiles, it was surprising how often a city block came down to swapping out the building on one key tile.
    
	6. Incredibly neat feature where you can seamlessly zoom down to first-person in your city. Spent a lot of time just walking around my city.
    

- [[Against the Storm]]
    

	1. City-builder
    
	2. Love the resource chains and the way the game resists blueprinted cities.
    
	3. Odd in that it has a major metaprogression system but I still play to experience more of the inner loop. Typically metaprogression systems throw the intrinsic fun out of balance in favor of extrinsic motivation towards metaprogression.
    
	4. One of my favorite games of the last several years.
    

- [[Clair Obscur - Expedition 33]]
    

	1. JRPG
    
	2. Delightful combat system. I was willing to trade some joint pain for the experience of parrying realtime attacks.
    
	3. Decent character build system.
    
	4. Most special because of its world and characters.
    
	5. Odd in that it’s a game that simply did everything right. It was both comfort food and art house at the same time.
    

# List of standouts I didn’t like or ended up hating

- [[Phantom Brigade]]
    

	- Tactics
    
	- Played on Steam Deck and perhaps that was a platform problem, but barely functioned.
    
	- The gameplay was touted as being innovative but it disappointed.
    

- [[Elden Ring]]
    

	- Action RPG, Soulslike
    
	- Just too hard and frustrating. I went through my phase with Soulslike but I think that’s over now.
    
	- This is an oddity: on paper, I should have loved enough about this game to have overcome my frustration. This game seems perfect for Bartle’s Explorer type which I certainly am.
    

- [[Skul - The Hero Slayer]]
    

	- Action platformer, roguelite
    
	- Dumb skeleton and bones aesthetic
    
	- Another game which seemed like it would speak to me because of the variety in character classes and the ability to swap between two or them. In practice though you have so little control over what class you play as.
    

- [[Bandle Tale]]
    

	- Slow life
    
	- Low-quality port. Performance wasn’t great and the controls didn’t feel naturally suited to a controller. Profoundly stupid aesthetically. I couldn’t care less about the grooflings or whatever stupid thing they were called. So much text in this game. Endless reading of meaningless dialogue. I had utterly no investment in the characters or world.
    

- [[Farm RPG]]
    

	- Idle
    
	- I spent a lot of time tapping for fish. This is the sort of game where you pay real money to reduce the number of times you have to tap.
    
	- I also deeply hate the characters and quests of this game.
    
	- This is a game I had a regrettable dalliance with for months. Between this and Obelisk Miner I’ve payed to gain some valuable wisdom.
    

- [[CrisTales]]
    

	- JRPG
    
	- Billed as innovative but I certainly never got to a point where I saw it.
	
	- Slow and wordy.
    

- [[Darkest Dungeon 2]]
    

	- Tactics
    
	- I liked the first a lot. I appreciate that this one took bold swings. I became disenchanted with it. Perhaps due to the punishing difficulty. I don’t think it’s probably any harder than DD1. 
    

- [[dot Age]]
    

	- City-builder
    
	- I liked it intensely for a while and then suddenly hated it. The Switch port wasn’t great. Controls didn’t work well. Buggy interface.
    
	- Really stupid vibe. Pixely cartoony characters. Another game where there was dialogue that would have been better off not in the game.
    

- [[SHADOWFRAME]]
    

	- Puzzle
    
	- SUPERHOT but terrible. Aesthetic and promise of “more SUPERHOT” suckered me into a $5 purchase. It’s rare that I spend $5 on something and hate it so much that I wish I had it back. This is one of those times.
    

- [[Storm Lancers]]
    

	- Action platformer, roguelite
    
	- Cataclysmically awful Switch port.
    
	- Lovely key art. Game graphics are a blurry mess.
    
	- Poor collision detection, uninspired enemies, woefully unbalanced difficulty, boring weapons, worst-in-class traversal.
    
	- Was advertised heavily and that suckered me in.
    

- [[BALL x PIT]]
    

	- Genre-blend: city-builder, “breakout clone” (I guess arcade game?), idle/autobattler
    
	- I did like how many classes there were
    
	- Another game where it hypnotized me for three days. By the end of the three days, when I was pushing to see the credits rolled, I already hated it. But couldn’t stop playing. I heaved a sigh of relief when I uninstalled it.
    

- [[System Shock (Remake)]]
    

	- First-person shooter, puzzle
    
	- Shattered my expectations in the negative way. I backed this game on Kickstarter close to a decade ago. Fundamentally, this game would have had to be incredible not to disappoint me. It wasn’t incredible and it wasn’t even good. Hookwinked again.
    

- [[Two Point Museum]]
    

	- “City-builder”
    
	- Can’t get past the start screen. Hard crash over and over. Hoodwinked and furious.
    

- [[Marvel Cosmic Invasion]]
    

	- Arcade, belt-scroller
    
	- Another case of unmet expectations.
    
	- Should have loved the multiple characters and the tag-teaming.
    

- [[Obelisk Miner]]
    

	- Idle
    
	- Caused, I think literal, addition for a couple of days.
    
	- I was able to break the game’s grip by turning the reins over to my ego in the Freudian sense. I recalled Farm RPG and BALL x PIT and knew I had to stop even if I didn’t want to.
    

My guess is that, as I go through this list, I will find the common theme that I hate games which make me feel duped or hoodwinked. Perhaps I bought something and got something much different or worse than I was expecting. Or, perhaps I had a brief and intense affair with a game, only to have the scales fall from my eyes and realize that I only enjoyed the dopamine hits of numbers going up rather than enjoyment of the actual gameplay.

  

I remember one of the earliest times I was making notes about the design of games was in 2015 during my first 1GAM year. I constrained myself to not include leveling systems because I believed that they might mask weakness in underlying gameplay by diverting attention to seeing numbers go up.

  

As I write this I’m whittling away on an idle game which I am confident I will come to hate soon.

# General notes

Major takeaways for predictive purchasing are highlighted.

- I was tempted to go back and double-check my readthrough of game titles. But: if something didn’t strike me the first time through, was it really a standout? And with each list being 15 or more entries, it’s unlikely that one or two missing entries will change my overall analysis.
    
- Of all the games on my standout-positive list, only about 20% could be considered mainstream (Clair Obscur, Prince of Persia, Unicorn Overlord). Even those are double-A games, not truly triple-A. All others are from smaller developers or with smaller scope. That doesn’t mean less polished though. Urbek is a great example of a niche game with a polished and smooth gameplay experience.
    
- Only a small subset of genres made it onto my standout-positive list in any way. JRPG, Strategy/GS, Metroidvania, RTS, city-builder, traditional roguelike, idle-autobattler, tactics, action platformer. (Some are blends so end up counted in more than once place)
    

- JRPG: 4
    

	- Obviously a top genre for me and has been since I was a child. No surprise.
    

- Strategy/GS: 4
    

	- The one I would have said I like the most now in general. This was my center of gravity as a PC gamer. (Still wish desperately for a Slipways port to Switch.)
    

- Metroidvania: 2
    

	- A fading attraction for me. I’ve played many in the last two years and I like most of them but love few of them.
    

- RTS: 2
    

	- A surprise. I nearly put Element on the list which would have made this 3. Worth a closer look in the future.
    

- City-builder: 2
    

	- Another genre that I would have said is one of my favorite genres now as an adult. However, as I think about, I’ve tried a number of city builders that didn’t come close to making this list. Perhaps this genre is more of an exponential shape or even a U shape for me. The best ones I love dearly, but by and large much in this category doesn’t stick.
    

- Traditional roguelike: 1
    
- Idle/autobattler: 1
    
- Tactics: 1
    
- Action platformer: 1
    

- Genres worth taking a risk on when browsing the eShop: JRPG, Strategy/GS, RTS.
    
- Genres to wait and trust reviews on: city-builder, tactics.
    
- Traditional roguelikes are so few and far between that I’ll likely buy anything in this genre that appears on the eShop. There’s a big caveat though: only Shiren and Tangledeep have had good Switch ports. All of the other ones I’ve bought have been so badly ported as to be unplayable (literally so in at least two cases).
    
- Of all the action-platformers, only one on this list. Not worth taking a chance on even for games with good reviews.
    
- Roguelites do not appear on my standout positive list at all. Not a single one. No Dead Cells, no Absolum, no Rogue Legacy, none of the countless indie roguelikes I’ve taken chances on. Stop buying these. Be wary even of games “with roguelite mechanics”.
    
- Idle/autobattler. I’ve liked some of these but not loved them. Necrosmith was special because of the RTS added to the mix and because of the unit-building. I think I just like unit-building as a single mechanic. Arguably this mechanic was in Unicorn Overlord as well.
    
- I’m surprised that no simulation games made it onto my standout-positive list.
    
- One of my takeaways from my standout-negative list is: if you are going to lean heavily on dialogue in your game, it better be good. If unsure, just take the dialogue out.
    
- Genre breakdown for games on my standout-negative list:
    

	- Tactics: 2
    
	- Action RPG: 1
    
	- Soulslike: 1
    
	- Action platformer: 2
    
	- Roguelite: 2
    
	- Slow life: 1
    
	- Idle: 3
    
	- JRPG: 1
    
	- City-builder: 3
    
	- Puzzle: 2
    
	- Arcade: 2
    
	- FPS: 1
    
	- Belt-scroller: 1
    

- Broader spread across the admittedly small sample size of my standout-negatives.
    
- Roguelites show up here and again not in the standout-positive. This genre or subgenre or however I should look at it has dried up for me.
    
- As expected, the biggest thing with these negative games is that most of them ending up on this list abused my goodwill in some way.
    
- The other major takeaway is that I should run far and run fast from idle games.
    
- This list leans heavy towards reflex-based or action type games. My standout positive leans heavily towards games that do not have a reflex or twitch component. That’s a big takeaways.
    
- The list of other memorable games span a mix of genres. Games with truly unique settings appear on this list quite a bit. That must appeal to me
    
- Balance between linear experiences vs. replayable experiences?
    

	- Positive list:
    

		- Linear: 7
    
		- Replayable: 9
    
		- More even than I would have predicted.
    

	- Negative list:
    

		- Linear: 7
    
		- Replayable: 6
    
		- Lifestyle: 2
    

- Not enough variation for this to be predictive.
    

- Balance between heavily systems driven games or not? Could say systems versus content driven. But that's similar to my intent with linear versus replayable. 
    

	- Positive:
    

		- Systems-driven: 11
		    
		- Non-systems-driven: 5
		    
		- List is weighted towards systems-driven. No surprise.
    

	- Negative:
    

		- Systems-driven: 9
		    
		- Non-systems-driven: 6
		    
		- Still weighted systems-driven.
    

- Looks like this is not useful as a predictive tool. Appears to reflect just the kind of games I like to play in general.
    

# Takeaway notes:

- Genres worth taking a risk on when browsing the eShop: JRPG, Strategy/GS, RTS.
    
- Genres to wait and trust reviews on: city-builder, tactics.
    
- Action-platformers are not worth taking a chance on even for games with good reviews.
    
- Be extremely wary of roguelites or even games “with roguelite mechanics.”
    
- Stay away from idle games.
    
- Be extremely judicious in purchasing games that have a reflex- or twitch-based element.
