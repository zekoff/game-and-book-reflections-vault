I started this log to improve my ability to critique. I wanted to be able to explain why something works or doesn't work. To hone my craft by observation and reflection. The double edge to this sword is that I may have lost some of the ability to just play a game and enjoy it for its own sake. I can't help but evaluate while I'm playing. It makes it a little harder to let the game just wash over me. And I think that's still important too. Both for my own joy and for a next step in critique. What a game must look like to the beginner's eye (Zen proverb?).

A couple of corollaries. Raph Koster would say it's important to be able to see a game two ways: the gears turning underneath stripped of all their thematic trappings, and the aesthetic effect of the game freed from all of its mechanisms. For critique, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: you can measure something with absolute precision at the cost of affecting its position, or you can let something keep it's position but accept imperfect measurement. You can critique something and lose its essence, or you can bathe in the essence and lose the chance to critique. 

It’s also made it a little burdensome to start a new game. I will sometimes stare at the game tiles on my Switch and then avoid a new one because I know I’ll have to make a new entry in this log. Ultimately I believe that’s been worth it though. It’s helped me hone my craft.
