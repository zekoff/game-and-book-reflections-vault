I admit to a little distress because this game implements one of my most treasured ideas. One that I thought, despite there being nothing new under the sun, was unique to me. Every character has an associated instrument and the soundtrack is based on those instruments. Changing the characters keeps the same song but with substituted instruments. So, what lessons can I learn from this game and apply to my eventual implementation? 

- The concept itself is satisfying. 
- Performance of the game, as in the frame rate, must be flawless. Interruption or disconnect of the soundtrack from the gameplay is mightily distracting. 
- Encouraging the player to swap characters is powerful. It highlights the central tweak that the instrumentation changes and that each character has their instrument. 
- The soundtrack has some consistent elements regardless of character selection. This allows for some surety that the music will fit together regardless of selected characters. 
- The music ramps up with additional intricacy and intensity based on success. It reinforces the pleasure when things are going well. 

As a remark on the game for its own sake, I like the set building to power up characters. This was also present in [[Brotato]]. The game is indeed a remix of many elements that have been seen before. 

I wonder about the pedigree of the game. The writing is done with care but imperfect application. I sense that it was written by someone for whom English was not a native tongue. Aesthetically it reminds me of [[Crown Trick]] for some reason. The characters are cute and with the squashed height ratios I've seen called “super deformed”.
