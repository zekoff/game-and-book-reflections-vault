This is an “opportunity cost” game. I like it. But do I like it enough to spend that time not playing another game? The aesthetic is cute (Studio Ghibli adjacent). Mechanically the twist of riding the back of the Onbu is integrated nicely. I never get tired of a zoom feature which highlights scale in a game. Zoom in to frame a person lifting a bundle of wood and then seamlessly zoom out to watch the entire complement of villagers scurry between buildings across the city-sized back of a fantasy creature. Early in the story the tribal-garbed villagers uncover an antenna tower and are contacted by a woman wearing a modern lab coat. That’s intriguing.

Would I rather play this or [[Terraformers]]? [[Jupiter Hell]]? [[Against the Storm]]? Even finish something I’ve already invested in like [[Trails in the Sky - First Chapter]]? I’d rather do the others. A shame. Luckily the developers already have my money. I’m glad to support this art.
