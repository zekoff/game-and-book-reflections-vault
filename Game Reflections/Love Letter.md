A game I’d heard about years ago as the pinnacle of elegance in design. The whole game is just twenty or so cards. There are tokens and a nice holding bag in the one I purchased, but those don’t actually affect the design of the game. There are only two steps to a turn: draw and play. And when you play the card, you simply execute the text on the card. In terms of the Mechanics-Dynamics-Aesthetics (MDA) framework, the M is barely there. But the D is rich. It brings out bluffing, card-counting, risk mitigation. And the A is something that feels light yet strategic, and there are wonderful “gotcha” moments, in particular when you play the Guard and correctly guess what your opponent is holding. It’s fun at two players, but I bet even better with more.
