What a surprise. Mickey is portrayed as quite a scamp. He appears most like his early versions. The opening sequence is dark. Yensid’s theme brings a dose of gravitas. There is a sense of real terror, high stakes, and even evil or at best villainy.

The game feels like a mid-2000s 3D action platformer -- which, I suppose, is exactly what it is despite the Rebrushed framing. Combat looks slick but feels weightless. It’s devoid of the many tricks that designers use to try and capture what the player intends to do instead of what they actually did. For example, Mickey can stomp on enemies’ heads to daze them. More often that not, though, a slight lack of precision means Mickey will just slide their collision volume to the side instead of landing a satisfying blow. A more modern approach would be to give the player the benefit of the doubt, knowing that their intention was almost certainly to perform the stomp, and ever-so-slightly nudge them to what they intended instead of what they did. The spin move is even more toothless. Against the very first and weakest enemy type, I had to spin-attack literally dozens of times before the enemy would perish. I’m still not even sure if my attacks were finally successful or whether my mind-controlled buddy dealt the blows.

The headline feature of the game is Paint and Thinner. Paint can fill in faded areas and convert enemies, and thinner can dissolve things. It’s disappointedly limited. The targets for painting and thinning are telegraphed almost too clearly. Little or no creativity in how and where to use them. That’s distinctly at odds with how you’d expect artistic tools to behave.

There is weirdly a morality system. A message at some point informs you that the world will react badly to overuse of Thinner. So… if I want to be a good guy, I have to limit my use of one of the core features of the game? There are also signposts that you can solve quests the nice way (with paint) or the naughty way (with thinner). I intentionally solved one quest the naughty way. A character told me I wasn’t very nice and instead I got a chest with a collectible.

I am not sure what I expected from a Warren Spector game, but it was definitely something different than this. It feels limited by the temporal context of its design instead of a game that moved the art form forward.
