Played about 15 minutes via Game Pass. Side-scroller platformer with omnidirectional aim. The moment to moment gameplay is competent if a little dry. Nothing hooked me and the competition for this space is so stiff that I wasn’t compelled to dig deeper.

This I suppose is the upside/downside of Game Pass. I might never have tried this game at all without GP… or, I might have paid $15 for it on the Switch eShop only to have the same reaction. However, if I’d spent any money for it specifically, I likely would have given it more of a chance before getting rid of it.
