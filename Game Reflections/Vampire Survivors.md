The Switch port is essentially indistinguishable from the PC version that I played on Steam Deck. There’s a huge missed opportunity to enable one-handed play with this game. Either thumbstick can be used for movement, but only the A button can make selections! So right-hand only play is possible, but why not make the L, or ZL, L-stick buttons useable for selections and thus enable left-hand-only play?
  
There’s a lot of content here via new characters and weapons and achievements. Maybe it’s just because I played a bit on Steam Deck, but the game really becomes samey quickly. It’s compulsive though, and I’m not sure I mean that as a compliment. It’s easy to lose an hour playing a game and look back thinking “what did the game give me for that time?”
