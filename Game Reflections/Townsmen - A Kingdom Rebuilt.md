Competent city-builder and more complex than I was expecting. It reminds me of [[Majesty]] but without the indirect control of military units. The hallmarks of city-builders are robust resource models, production chains, worker assignment, and simulated pathing.

I think of this against the city-builder I’ve spent the most time with: [[Against the Storm]]. It honestly compares pretty favorably. AtS is more to my taste because of the variability in what will be available and thus the on-the-fly adaptation to how the city should be built. I really like the modifiable production chains in AtS.
