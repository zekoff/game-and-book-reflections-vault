Played about two hours. At my current level of familiarity with this genre, I am able to project out how the mechanics will create the experience to a confident degree. 

Tweaks the game makes to the Spirelike formula:

1. The deck is always 20 cards. Cards gained can be subbed in and out from a sideboard. This takes card removal away as a mechanism. Less ability to sculpt the deck but a tradeoff for more ability to design. Leads the game away from deckbuilder and towards a CCG.
2. Enemy group composition is visible prior to each battle. When combined with bullet 1, this means it's optimal and even required to rebuild your deck prior to each battle, and tailor it to those opponents. This will increase the level of familiarity required to succeed deeper in the runs and enemies scale and more tailored decks are needed. It does insert some fiddliness prior to each battle. The UI for subbing cards in and out is slow with a controller. It generates a significant stop-and-analyze task every single battle. This slows the pacing significantly. 
3. You can choose to Purge cards from your hand. Doing so discards it and gives you energy to play more cards. The energy economy hinges on this to a large degree. It prompts frequent assessment of how to get the most value out of cards since each card has at least two potential uses. In particular it eliminates one of the pain points of [[Slay the Spire]], where drawing guard cards felt very bad on turns where enemies weren’t attacking. Guarding in StS feels like a punishment. Here it feels fine.
4. Relics are much less frequent. For me this is a great change. I tire of the overwhelming amount of relics in many similar games because it forces either complete focus for the duration of a run or constant cross-referencing of relics versus deck and playstyle to make sure you are playing optimally. It is extremely poorly suited to pick-up-and-play on the Switch.

Minor tweaks:

- The map has a “plot your course” feature. It makes the process of planning a floor into something explicit. This is a straight QoL upgrade with no downside. 
- Gems can be slotted onto cards to power them up slightly. This was explicitly part of [[Roguebook]] and was essentially present in [[Monster Train]]. I appreciate this feature because it feels like breaking the rules even though the game is of course tuned for it. Upgrade Points can also be spent to give a straightforward power increase to a card, just like StS.
- Damage taken from enemy attacks is modeled as “Threat”. When an enemy attacks, the damage goes into a “Threat” buffer. The buffer empties on the next turn and does that amount of damage. I don’t fully have my head around how drastically this would change my approach. After having completed two normal runs I still think it works functionally similar to standard attacking in similar games. It is harder to understand and it's unclear why this was worth the cost in unfamiliarity.
- Each character has a spell that can be cast on a cooldown. The spell is probably equivalent to a rare card but costs no energy to cast. Effective use of the spell probably won’t turn the tide of a battle but would definitely reduce overall damage taken in the battle and thus aid in the overall attrition from progression.

There are a few other differences (potions, map movement, booster packs) as well but nothing else that is a significant iteration on the genre. 

This is like a new fantasy novel. There is a known market for this. It's well made. It doesn't break too much new ground and I don't think it was trying to. It meshes mostly existing elements. I think it was designed as a variation on StS. They started from the observation that StS is a powerful framework. They then identified ways that StS could be improved, built mechanics that created that experience, then skinned them as best as possible. 

I think of Dan Cook’s exceptional essay on the evolution of genres in video games. Late-stage genre work becomes insular and highly specific. This is the case here. There are dozens of keywords that I’d have to memorize to play it on a high level. Discard, Purge, Expel, Volatile, Taunt, Shock, Burn, Poison, Rebound, Overcharge, Blessed, Ghost, Vulnerable, Weakness, Frenzy, AP, Combo, Zeal, Chain, Rage, Opener, Slow, Block, Evasive, Rigged, Delay… off the top of my head. It’s so complex that near the end of my runs I essentially stop paying attention to most of the words. The UI becomes a clouded mess of icons and tooltips and I just run the plays in my playbook until the health bars go away.

I’m glad I had the opportunity to play this because it was useful to practice analysis. It’s one I doubt I’ll want to return to, even though it’s well-done.
