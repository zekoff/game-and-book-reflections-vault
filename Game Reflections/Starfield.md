I jotted this game down as I was starting this list in 2023, and only now and going back to add something to it in 2024. I have absolutely lukewarm memories of this game. The main story path had all the beats of something emotional but never landed hard. The on-foot combat checked all the boxes but didn’t carry the game on its own. The spaceship builder was neat but only because you eventually got to walk around inside your ship. The space combat was… yep, it was space combat. The companion characters were Bethesda companions -- likable in each of their own ways, but not developed enough to be core figures outside of the game. I absolutely didn’t dislike this game. Its promise was always just out of reach, though, no matter how long I played. It was somewhere in an uncanny valley: not quite a linear story game where I can’t wait to hit the next story beat, not quite a survival craft-em-up where there’s a mechanical tension to playing it, not quite a grind-fest where I could turn my brain off and just go through the motions. I haven’t returned since I got to NG+3, and I don’t know that I ever will.
