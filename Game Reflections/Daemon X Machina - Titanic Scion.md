Demo version. Looking at the HUD there’s a lot I should like. Bunches of weapon slots and meters. The action is kind of a blurry mess. Visually and mechanically. I can’t easily tell where attacks are coming from. My starter weapons are underwhelming. A giant katana has a one-hit combo strike. An assault rifle that fires one bullet every second. Later a laser sword using the same animation and a light machine gun that spit bullets doing 1-2 damage at a time.

I think it’s that the inputs don’t flow smoothly together. Throwing a grenade causes the mech to halt and perform the throwing animation. No physical reaction between mechs either. There are certainly collision volumes but strikes don’t knock either mech around. They just mash into each others’ geometry and damage numbers pop out.

I do like that the mechs are suits rather than robots. Not sure why I’m leaning that way but I appreciated it. They also look cool. None of the superdeformed nonsense.
