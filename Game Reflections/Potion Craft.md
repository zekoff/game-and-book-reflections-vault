Predictably, the Switch port suffers from lengthy load times upon game start, although it’s pretty smooth once actually playing. I jumped back in after putting a dozen hours into this game on my Steam Deck last year. I felt that I’d seen what the game had to offer when I walked away from it the first time. Playing again now, it appears that I was right. It’s a solid game but I won’t be putting another dozen hours in.

One thing that works against it for me is that it preys upon my compulsion not to use consumables in RPGs. Every time you craft a potion, you’re using a consumable! The plants grow back day over day, and as far as I can tell there’s not a penalty for just taking it slowly, but knowing that I’m using up resources makes me play more cautiously.
