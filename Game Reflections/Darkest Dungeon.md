Brutal tactics roguelite. Art style that blends cosmic horror with comic book lines. Consider that [[XCOM]] has tactical gameplay in both an X and Y dimension (standard cartesian grid with an isometric viewpoint). Darkest Dungeon's innovation was to compress that grid into a single dimension.

Darkest Dungeon has no campaign-level fail state. The metaprogression of the city only progresses in the direction of more power. Any individual party can be wiped out. For a party of maximum-level characters (level 6) with curated gear, this is a huge setback in terms of player time. Compare/contrast to [[Darkest Dungeon 2]], in which a failed party results in a return to the stagecoach's start. They actually aren't too dissimilar to one another in that way. In fact, DD2 may be more respectful of the player.
