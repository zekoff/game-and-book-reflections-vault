It’s exactly what I thought I was getting. Each attempt is 60 seconds long. Information gained in one attempt is captured in my brain and useful for the next attempt. Some gear is collected and persists between lives but the real fun for me is that I myself am learning things. In that it is actually most like a true traditional roguelike, where repeated runs don’t make my character better -- they make me better.

My favorite part so far was seeing an old man near a lighthouse. He speaks very slowly and the hint you need from him comes at the very end of his dialogue. To hear it you must sprint from your starting location and start his dialogue then sit and listen as the time ticks down, getting the last words just as it expires.
