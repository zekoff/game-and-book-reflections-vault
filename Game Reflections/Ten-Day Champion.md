Most like the [[Persona]] games from the perspective of the outer game loop. You manage your day in blocks of time. Moving to a location takes 30 minutes, searching out a random battle takes 3 hours, etc. In that time you are gaining strength in one way or another -- levels, skill points, equipment.

I ventured into a new area and searched out a random battle where I was easily defeated. This resulted in a Game Over. Not a “reload from save” -- an actual character deletion and return to the title screen. While I was shocked that this was the result of losing a single battle, I think I like it. It gives the game high stakes and is of course thematically consistent. I do hate seeing Game Over screens that aren’t thematically integrated into a game. Since the scope of the game is presumably only 10 days it’s not terribly burdensome to restart. Unlike Labyrinth or whatever that other Playdate game was. In that one the game could theoretically be infinite except for the fact that there’s no game save functionality. I’m still not over that.

At the beginning of the game you choose a class. The warrior type’s special passive is a 40% chance to not lose Wound status on an enemy after attacking. I was skeptical that this would make any difference at all. Boy was I right. Boring perk with no real measurable impact on the game. This is far on the other side of the spectrum from the more boardgame influenced perks that are significant, concise, and more in the design flavor in modern design.

Quite some time later -- returned to this game and have a warmer reaction to it that before. The combat system is more flexible than I assumed. Mana points combine with variable cooldowns to avoid combat being rote. There are a fairly small number of enemy types and most of them respond to a tailored strategy to promote success. There’s also an option to improve the starting class trait and this does make a big difference. Skill points for upgrading the character are reasonably generous. I made it to the gladiatorial combat and lost in the semi-finals. I would have benefitted from having a different set of skills to choose from, plus I was also statistically outclassed. I do think there’s room to try again and be more successful.
