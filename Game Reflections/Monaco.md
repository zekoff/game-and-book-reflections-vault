Honestly, for several years I’ve tried to crack this game open. I played it first on Xbox in the XBLA era and bounced off. I purchased it for Switch a while back as an attempt to get a co-op experience going with Lauren, but it didn’t stick. Recently I listened to a podcast interviewing the designer and realized how lauded it was when it released in the early indie era. It seemed like there must have been something I was missing. So I redownloaded and committed to completing at least the first few levels. It at least stuck this time. The graphics are very unique but also difficult to parse as you play. The character classes are quite distinct. This is one of the game’s greatest delight. I also appreciate that being spotted is not a fail state. You can escape and hide, you can lead your pursuers on a merry chase, or you can sprint for the exit. All that only if you actually do get spotted. The game is paced and the levels are designed such that you can methodically get through the level in stealth. One of the biggest contributors to this ability is that getting in line of sight for an enemy does not immediately alert them. An awareness meter fills up, quickly if you’re very exposed, but gives you some time at least to adjust. And as I parsed the art design more and more, I started to notice elegant and useful touches, like enemies hidden from sight generating faint footstep marks to show how the character can hear them.

I don’t think I’ll see this one through to the end, but I at least understand better why it crashed onto the scene so hard at first release.
