Played on Game Pass, about 3 hours in now. The Tactical Time Dilation system is compelling. It brings the “nearly-turn-based” feel of VATS in [[Fallout 3/4]], but feels much more fluid since the aiming is direct-control (versus VATS where body parts are selectable as essentially menu options). This is firmly a “first-person RPG” that calls to mind [[System Shock 2]] more than anything else. It’s heavily stats-driven, and it signals that those stats are more important than any twitch skills.

I like the skills and inventory systems so far. Items scavenged from enemies and the world can be sold as junk, or broken down into component parts. With the right skills, existing weapons can be leveled up to keep their strength on pace with enemies. The skill system is crunchy and meaningful. There are a handful of top-level skill groups like “Ranged” and “Tech”, under which are found the specific skills like “Long Guns” or “Engineering”. A healthy number of skill points are awarded each level. When dropped onto a skill group, a point levels up all the skills in that group up to 50, after which points must go directly onto individual skills to continue leveling them up. These skill bumps give incremental upgrades every point, and also special abilities that unlock at multiples of 20 points in each skill. There is also a perk system that’s roughly similar to Feats in D&D5E, where you get a Perk point only infrequently, but each perk you spend gives you a notable capability enhancement, like 50% faster recharge on TTD.

I’d known about this game for a while but simply never jumped in, and it’s been a neat counterpoint to [[Starfield]]. Starfield is a game that can be everything to everyone, and in fact ends up a little watered-down because of it. Starfield does everything well and nothing excellently. Starfield is 80% of an RPG, and 80% of an FPS, and 80% (well, OK, maybe 60%) of an immersive sim, and 80% of a flight sim… Outer Worlds is 100% of an RPG, and apparently when I want an RPG, maybe I just want an RPG.
