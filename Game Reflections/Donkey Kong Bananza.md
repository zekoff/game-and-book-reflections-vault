Kind of a mess. Played for around five hours total, enough to get to “Sublayer 300”. I couldn’t shake the feeling of playing [[Astroneer]] -- the look is similarly polygonal and the terrain deforms in instant chunks. There are a plethora of particle effects which cover well for the terrain deformation.

The game is designed with care. Fundamental tension between the freedom of manipulating the terrain with the need to create an authored experience. The inability to create terrain does put some limitations on the freedom and force you into authored content. If something is far above you, you won’t be able to get there by piling terrain on itself and jumping. The game feels unpleasantly physics-based when doing things like turf surfing but even when doing things like climbing and performing basic jumps. You’re only ever 90% confident that DK will perform the platforming maneuver that you expect when making an input. That is death for a game which is so fundamentally steeped in platforming. Camera is a nightmare. It pulls in impossibly tight sometimes, zooms out and turns terrain transparent sometimes. Again, you can’t count on what it will do. Terrain deformation makes it easy to get pointlessly stuck. Punch into a ramp when you didn’t really mean it, and now you are digging into the side of a mountain instead of walking up it.

My guess is that the game’s original thesis statement was settled on and taken to its natural conclusion with all possible Nintendo polish applied. The problem is that the thesis statement was weak. Create a voxel-based authored platforming game.

Pauline is a shot of charisma in the arm of a game which needs it. DK has great animations but I just don’t connect with the aesthetic. The opening hour is… monkey miners and textbox dialogue?

Banana skill points were a mistake. It moves the reward of collecting a banana to intrinsic. Versus the moons in [[Super Mario Odyssey]] which were extrinsic. In Odyssey the reward for collecting a moon is the success and the creative challenge that you overcame. In DKB the reward is one fifth of a skill point. And the skill points do one of two things -- unlock an ability you should have had from the start (e.g. terrain-throw double-jumping) or make an anemic power slightly less anemic (e.g. another health point, “60% increased range on radar”). Boy, that last one actually embarrasses me now that I think about it.

Never understood the DK lineage. The original DKC always felt like the most basic of platformers. Something that, graphics notwithstanding, any company could have made. The only thing Rare brought to the table was the then-unparalled graphical whizbang.
