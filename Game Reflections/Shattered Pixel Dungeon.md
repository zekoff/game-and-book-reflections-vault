I've been playing this game on and off for years. I don't know that I've played it since I started this log, this it's entry here. This is my favorite traditional rogue like. It's deep and extremely accessible. It prompted some analysis in another document which I've copy pasted here. 

- Definitive version of Pixel Dungeon
- Cursed items go w/ item ID system. Otherwise, no risk to equipping items and testing them.
- Curse effects are unique effects (versus simple negative modifiers as in Nethack). Much better than [[Nethack]].
- ID system very important throughout.
- Stone of Intuition lets you benefit from observation to make more out of single scroll. One scroll can become two stones, and each stone, if correctly used, can identify two scrolls or potions.
- [[DCSS|Dungeon Crawl - Stone Soup]] did away with curses as far as I know.
- Multi-use things like Well of Healing (which heals, provides full satiety, and cleanses equipped items). Potion of Levitation can be quaffed to bypass traps, or thrown to create a vertigo cloud. Well of Knowledge shows you which of you inventory items are cursed or uncursed, and gives mind-vision on the current stage.
- Talent system is used for builds. Allows for preference and some expressive play.
- After you achieve a moderate comfort level, there are virtually no surprise deaths.
- Defining systems of SPD relative to other roguelikes: artifacts and alchemy, according to the developer. I would add “terrain” based on how impactful it is and how underutilized it is in other roguelikes. Terrain includes water, vegetation (which can have multiple states), and empty squares (which can include traps).
- Ankh is this game’s “amulet of lifesaving”.
- All the systems are intertwined. Class design, item list, terrain, artifacts, alchemy, identification, level generation.
- Traditional bump combat with ranged options.
- Some dungeon rooms are tied to potions. A trap room means a potion of levitation will be somewhere on the floor. A
- Challenge system. Of which, “Badder Bosses” and “Enemy Champions” are the true way to play.
- Inventory management is a point of friction although it never necessarily plays a defining role. The inventory expansion options are important also because they protect or improve their class of items.
- Shops offset randomness. So does alchemy.
- Rings, artifacts, class, spec, armor and weapon all combine to define a build.
- Bosses as checkpoints and as ways of forcing you to play differently.
- Enemies offer genuinely different challenges. There are only a few enemy classes and they all force a different response to the problems they present.
- Magic versus physical damage. Present different challenges without requiring hard counters.
- Scrolls of upgrade are also a defining feature.
- Compare to crabs in OG Pixel Dungeon.
- The UI in general is transformative. A true classical roguelike with commensurate depth that can be played in a portrait mode phone using one hand.
- Weapons have some distinctive characteristics, but there aren’t an overwhelming number of them. Armor is comparatively straightforward: one type of armor per tier.
- Weapon enchantment and armor glyph systems.
- List in UI of all discovered and identified item types.
- There are a number of modifier effects for each base items. Ex. each seed grows a different type of plant, and each plant has its own distinct effect, with the Warden subclass getting another distinct effect from each plant. Seeds can alternately be used to cook potions. Potions can be upgraded into alternate (generally more powerful) versions. Those can often be upgraded again by combining with other items. Wands have a variety of effects but also a specific alternate effect when imbued to the Battlemage’s staff, and another effect for the Elemental Blast armor ability of the mage.
- Many roguelikes have a way of retreating from a bad combat situation. In SPD, the alchemy pots can sometimes serve as a retreat/regroup destination. Alchemy pots also let you prepare for upcoming challenges.
- Quests
- You don't have to maximize your play to win. Can make some sub optimal choices and still win. Also means you have room for some expressive play.
- Secret rooms. Make exploration and attention to detail important. Although, compare against auto explore.
- Food clock, versus DCSS which removed food in favor of auto explore. The food clock is tuned well so that you can’t grind or hit search on every tile. If you don’t manage your resources well you can run out of food, but if you do manage them well, you’ll make it to the final boss with food to spare.
- Game is good at creating emergent tactical puzzles. Grass plus sleeping enemies. Wand of warding. Ranged enemies. Exploding skeletons. Terrain types.

Tricks:
- ID a potion by waiting till you have three of the seeds, then crafting it.
- Apply first scroll of upgrade to sealed armor.
- Potion of mind vision, then scroll that affects everything in view.
- Save a potion of invisibility by cloaking past the piranha room instead of drinking potion.
- Save a potion of levitation by using a stone of disarming in the trapped treasure room.
- Set off a fire trap with raw meat to grill it.
- If you see a well of healing, try out all your unknown gear while sitting next to it. Anything that’s cursed will be cleansed when you drink from the well.
- Also need to include what doesn’t work well.
- Early levels can feel feast-or-famine. They aren’t necessarily easy, because you haven’t collected enough skills/levels or loot to have many options at your disposal. They can feel a little binary in that either the RNG makes them a breeze, or you get in an actual unwinnable situation. Floor 3, when crabs appear, will often wipe you out.
- Slime enemies are one of the few no-value-added enemy types. Their description says it’s difficult to do more than 6 damage at a time, but this has never been a constraint for me in over 100 games. You just don’t do much damage at that level.
- Very early game is dangerous. Danger tends to decrease as game goes on if you are getting good drops and being wise with your resources. After my first win (so, having seen all of the boss fights and enemy types), I have not lost many games after the second area. Lose almost all games now on either floor 3 or 4.
- Playthroughs become very same-y after a while. This is probably the greatest weakness of the game compared to DCSS, which makes heavy use of branches.
- Some light meta knowledge useful for becoming good at the game. For example, knowing that exactly 2 strength potions spawn per biome, and exactly 3 scrolls of upgrade spawn. On the flip side, you could figure this out just by playing enough. But you couldn't figure it out in a single playthrough.
- Searches are guaranteed to succeed. If there’s a trap or secret door nearby, you’ll always find it by searching. This is absolutely transformative compared to the Nethack approach where you may need to repeat searching ten or fifty times. In Nethack you need to lean on the ability repeat a command a specified number of times.

At the time I’m writing this, I’ve played 364 games, of which 69 are victories, and of those 69 about half of them are probably ascensions. Many of them are also with challenge modifiers added. I’m at the point where my non-challenge games either end on Floor 3 or are wins. I can start a non-challenge run and feel the freedom to choose whatever build I think will be fun on that game. With Enemy Champions and Badder Bosses enabled, I feel pressure to optimize my builds, and wins aren’t guaranteed. Many times with challenges I’ve died deep in the dungeon, usually in the Dwarven Halls.

The food clock is tuned so that it's a strategic concern but not a tactical concern. You never have to avoid a single move or leave a room unexplored. You can't however return to previous floors without considering it. It also makes food-related artifacts and alchemy items viable but not required.

In December 2023, in advance of a 3.0 patch which would release the game’s sixth class, I challenged myself with a “shoot the moon” sequence. Ten wins in a row, one with each subclass of every class. Three times I broke the chain with a loss and had to start over. The final time was on the seventh run of that sequence and was particularly heartbreaking. I’m not convinced I’d ever strung more than three or four wins together without a break in the chain. This challenge required me to actually get better at the game. Some lessons I learned or that finally sunk in specifically as a result of this challenge:

- The most dangerous floors in the entire game are floors 3 and 4. Crabs are the most likely source of a break in the chain of wins. They move at double speed which means they are inescapable at this point in a run. They also hit fairly hard. Most character classes won’t have much in their bag of tricks yet either which means these fights will usually just be trading blows until one of you is dead. Floor 3 is something you have to cobble together preparations for with whatever little you find on 1 and 2.
- Highly enchanted armor is far and away the most important piece of equipment to string multiple wins together. It’s not even close. Powerful weapons and rings are the most fun and they’ll work out most of the time. But I’ve never lost from not hitting hard enough. I’ve only lost from getting hit too hard too many times.
- It’s acceptable to use a couple of Scrolls of Upgrade to cover gaps in early game equipment. If you get unlucky and don’t have any enchanted equipment going into the Sewer boss, it’s worth spending a scroll on a piece of tier 2 equipment. The same continues to be true as you progress deeper although the RNG will usually smooth out by the caverns.
- Similarly, the best choice from the Sewer quest is almost always the lower-tier option. The only time it’s worth rolling the dice on the higher-tier pick is if you’ve already got a T2 weapon and armor.
- Preferably before the Caverns, it’s important to find a way to close the gap on magic wielders that catch you off guard. This can be something like a seed of swiftthistle in an emergency. The terrain of the Sewers will usually provide a way to line-of-sight the robots. That’s less likely to be the case in the Caverns. The kobolds have stronger magic and apply debuffs. The warlocks are even worse. You need to be able to count on one hand the number of times a warlock gets a free ranged hit on you.
- Wands are probably the most important when there’s a choice between artifact, ring, and wand. Just about every wand will help any kind of run. Artifacts range from situationally powerful to useless depending on the class. Rings, although they are still my favorite, are the least important of the three. The only time rings are really important is if you luck out on one that synergizes well with your class and equipment.
- Sight distance is important. One of the secret best perks of the sniper is the talent for longer sight. Irrespective of her ranged attacks it’s important defensively. Dark floors and the Underworld put you at major risk and this talent neutralizes them.
- It’s probably worth using a Scroll of Magic Mapping on trap floors from Floor 16 onwards.
- Especially before getting the scroll holder, if you can get a set of the eight water bottles, it’s worth it. They save your scrolls, can prevent a lot of HP loss from burning relative to their cost in alchemy energy, and they can be used for repositioning including knocking enemies into pits. This item is really the swiss army knife of the game. And because they can break traps, a bottle or two to break traps in the levitation hazard room is actually a discount on the potion of levitation which would otherwise be the solution.
- You will want a blessed ankh as soon as possible. Most games you will not need it. But it will save the win chain from freak accidents. You have to complete 250 unbroken floors in a row to complete this challenge. There’s going to be a freak accident or three somewhere in those 250 floors. And don’t play around the fact that you have a blessed ankh by trying to be too stingy with use of healing sources.
- Zoos are almost never worth tapping. They’re tempting because they can help slingshot you forward to some extra talent points. But the risk is almost never worth it. The least-bad way to handle them is a Scroll of Rage.
- I found the inflection point of most runs to be the Caverns quest reward. At that point, almost always enough different gear had dropped for me to decide what my build would be, and I could spend the points with the smith to take the first few steps down that endgame build path. This was usually the place where I committed to my endgame armor in particular. If I had access to plate then I’d enchant it to 6 so I could wear it early and then be done with it. If all I had by that point was scale mail, I’d put a few upgrades in it to stay ahead of the damage curve and then parcel out a few more scrolls over the next floors. This would put more burden on upgrading and using the weapon and other items in the bag of tricks, since I’d be subject to significantly more overall damage as I went. But it was worth that suboptimal armor because it would make me viable through the Dwarven City, where even +3 mail is no longer good enough.

At this point I am willing to say that I’m an accomplished player of this game. The only challenges tracked by the game that I haven’t yet completed are the ones that essentially go hand-in-hand -- a million-point run and a six-challenge run. This shoot-the-moon challenge is more representative of skill than those very edge-case oddities. A few more things I’ve picked up that weren’t specific to this shoot-the-moon challenge:

- All of the areas are dangerous but the Underworld is really the only area where you’ll need to build towards having an answer for specific enemies. Scorpions require a completely reliable way to chase them down or otherwise neutralize them. It’s so important that it should be the deciding factor in your armor ability if you don’t otherwise have an answer. Beholders require that you have a way to avoid or soak a deathgaze. Generally you’ll be able to lure them into favorable terrain to whittle them down but there will be times where you’ll see a deathgaze coming and not be able to use standard movement to get to safety.
- Use-IDing scrolls is never really dangerous but it’s far suboptimal compared to energizing them or converting them to runestones at an alchemy pot. Use-IDing potions is a bad idea. It should only be done if it’s absolutely the only way to ID a potion of strength before floor 3. It’s probably not even worth use-IDing to solve a hazard room. You’ll want to come back later still but just wait until you have a stone of ID.
- There’s rarely a reason to enchant weapons or armor past +6. Both of these gear types get flat bonuses from each enchantment level. This has diminishing marginal returns. A +1 is vitally important early in the game and +3 is still quite important but mainly because it gives access to higher tier equipment while under-strengthed. +6 is a fine target for endgame weapons and armor.
- Rings are the opposite. Rings scale exponentially with upgrades. If you find a ring with good synergy and your armor is in good shape, it’s possibly worth dumping the rest of your scrolls into the ring instead of your weapon.
- Random weapon enchants are actually a pretty dicey proposition. Blazing enchant, on balance, causes more problems than it solves. It’s probably still worth using a stone of enchantment if you have it and are not a Huntress, but you will have to definitively change the way you approach encounters if you get blazing and don’t have a way to manage it, like armor with brimstone. Even if you do manage it, know that you’re going to lose a bunch of dewdrops and scrolls.
- Wells of Healing are the best early-game secret room. Wait till you’re starving and hurt, pile on all of your gear to test for curses, and then make all those problems go away.
- You’ll hit the last alchemy pot with way more resources than you need.
- Other than the water bottles refined from potions of levitation, the other swiss army knife is a highly-upgraded wand of prismatic light. This is harder to come by. But it’s a semi-reliable blind for magic users, it reveals secrets way more efficiently than searching relative to the hunger clock, it does decent damage so is especially useful for guaranteeing a final hit, and the blessing of light it confers neutralizes dark floors and helps in the Underworld.    
- With judicious hunger management, food will probably not be a factor by the time you get to the Dwarven City.
- Just because a monster appears on the screen does not mean the next move is to approach it and fight it. Discretion is often the better part of valor even late in the game with a full suite of abilities and items. This is especially true when playing with the Champion modifier active. Many times I’ve just completely avoided giant enemies.
- Trading blows is almost never the situation you want to be in, outside of maybe the Berserker. It’s usually important to soften an enemy up beforehand or to dip into your class abilities for almost every single encounter.
