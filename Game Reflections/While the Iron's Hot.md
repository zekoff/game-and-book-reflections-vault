Played on Game Pass, and really tried to give it a reasonable shot. It’s pixel-art style and fairly low polish. The crafting minigames didn’t add up to much in my playtime of a couple or three hours. There was quite a bit of moving around the map and around towns, talking with people, and surprisingly little actual crafting on balance. It feels like it “competes in an area where it’s not competitive”. That, plus some general jank that rises almost to the level of bugginess, and a sluggish (not sedate) pace, pushed me away.
