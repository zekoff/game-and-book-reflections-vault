Music is quite loud by default and distracting. It doesn't match the game well, or at least it doesn't match the experience I was looking for in the game. There are only a couple of tracks that I heard. One I slowed down and listened to to analyze it. There is a repeating baseline that drives the thing relentlessly. Top notes are synthy. The most distracting and off-putting part is a liberal use of note bends. The end result is something that feels like eerie scifi dance music. 

Game play is fine. [[Tetris]]-ish. Overall art direction is painterly. Every point threshold you must choose between two pairs. Something beneficial and harmful. The benefits give you something that will be useful in the future and the harmful effect will be something that is harmful now. I'd prefer the reverse so that I could plan and mitigate the expected harmful effect. 

Overall a surprisingly unpleasant experience. I walk away with the sense that the game isn't totally sure what experience it is trying to create.
