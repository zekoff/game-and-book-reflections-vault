Screams “indie RPG” in the best way. Built around a job system, and the difficulty is significant at times. The Cave of Trials taught me you can and should just skip enemies at times. There is a heavy and surprising emphasis on platforming and exploration. The text at the beginning is useful both for setting the tone and for tutorialization -- it says that adventure comes when you don’t know exactly where you’re going. Useful since you will go into areas early on where there’s no map, and you have to look carefully at the voxel landscape to even see how to progress.

The world feels big (probably, is big). There is a lot of verticality to the environments.

The exploration has kept me coming back, but I eventually had to turn to a guide to get unstuck from a certain area where I wasn’t sure how to progress. A surprising amount of the critical path of the game feels like it relies on sequence-breaking tricks in the platforming, like pixel-perfect jumps, which I don’t really appreciate. It’s probably a tough line to straddle between mandating true exploration and mandating these almost-exploits.

The class system continues to be fun. Not completely flexible, but compelling and enjoyable.

I returned to this in early 2026 because of my fond memories. This time, the exploration is what drove me away. There is no direction on where to go next. Why doesn’t this feel like pleasurable exploration? It must have something to do with moving around the world. The game relies heavily, perhaps completely, on some basic platforming in 3D space to explore. The jump is serviceable. Movement has some momentum so feels enough like a true platformer. It is difficult to tell what places you can jump to because of the fixed head-on top-down perspective. There also isn’t even guidance of the degree “explore one of these regions next”, or “here are the regions which are open but for which you haven’t found a crystal.” The flexibility in the job system continued to delight. In a last gasp of hope I went into the options and turned on all assist modes. XP, LP, Gold, multiple warp points. This was nice because it kept the combat punchy while reducing the grinding. It wasn’t enough to save the listlessness I felt from having no destination nor even idea of how to find one. The nail in the coffin was the fact that I knew I was missing entire regions because of a single cleverly-concealed cube I could have jumped to And that fact would be a progression stopper.
