Still probably my favorite overall two-player tabletop game. With a good opponent, it’s remarkable how often it produces close games. There’s enough uncertainty that you can’t really choose a victory condition at the beginning and still have a hope of winning. There is surprise during the game (as a result of not all cards being revealed at the beginning of each age) that you may have to pivot your strategy as the game goes on. I initially used the word “randomness” instead of “surprise”, but in fact there’s no real randomness in the game. There is hidden information, and the starting conditions are randomized via shuffled cards, but during the game I can’t think of any actual randomness.

By and large, the game is more winnable via a balanced strategy leading to a victory point win (“Culture” in the game’s parlance). However, there are also two outright victory conditions (“Military” and “Scientific”) and that gives additional axes of play.
