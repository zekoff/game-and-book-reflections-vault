The thing I remember the most is the way that you fire little pins into enemies which you can then hold down a button to shock. I believe the shock could chain between enemies. The revelatory thing for me was the ability to damage enemies by holding a button rather than spamming one. This vaulted the game immediately over the [[Megaman series]] for me with few exceptions.
