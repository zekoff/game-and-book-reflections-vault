Strange and pleasing blend of [[Breakout]] and [[Vampire Survivors]]. 

Compulsive finish. The last three hours before I beat it I only put it down once, to charge my Switch. I hated it and at the same time I couldn't let it go. The pre credit sequence was a kaleidoscope and it hypnotized me. I had an experience of dissociation while the colors spun. 

Grateful for roguelites with an end lately. The drip feed meta progression slows but credits roll before it grinds to a halt. I felt relief when this happened for this game. I feel like I have been sated even though the game could of course continue. I don't feel the same sense of being trapped with traditional roguelites. I keep coming back to the well, but because I'm thirsty, not because the well has been drugged and I'm addicted. 

Wacky upgrades. The game keeps breaking itself. Each of the classes is unique. An upgrade also allows the combination of any two classes. In run evolutions and fusions allow the feeling of further breaking the game with creativity. As I neared the end I was conversant enough with the evolution trees, and had a feel for controlling the random upgrades rolls, such that I could actually target certain builds of equipment and enjoy the payoff.
