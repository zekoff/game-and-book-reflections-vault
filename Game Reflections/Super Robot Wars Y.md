Demo version revealed only a very basic isometric tactics game. Lots of text and static portraits to wade through before even getting that far. There must be some deep thematic connection required with the mechs required in order to appreciate this game. The super-deluxe version or whatever costs over $100 so I think I’m just understanding the target audience. Also it seems like it's going way out of its way to not use the word “Gundam”.
