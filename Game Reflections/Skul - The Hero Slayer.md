Coming to this game right after [[Astral Ascent]], I was struck first by the fact that you cannot hold the attack button to auto-attack. This approach is actually more common, but I was so used to auto-attacking that it caught me off guard. I kept hitting the attack button as I’ve been trained to do for decades, and it took me a minute to realize why I felt it was off-putting. Ultimately, this single fact is why I quit the game early. Assuming I play this game for 25 hours like I did for Astral Ascent, I’d have to hit the “Y” button on my Switch on the order of 200,000 times to perform all of the basic attacks I’d perform in that time frame. There are also heads (basically, character classes) that attack as fast as you can press the button. Deleted the game as soon as I found this archetype. Where my damage output is limited by my ability to physically press a button faster.

Again, coming right on the heels of Astral Ascent, Skul has a little more of an “idle game” or “clicker” feel: there are many small fry enemies, which don’t pose a challenge, and explode in a shower of gibbets and coins after a few repeated attacks. Larger and more dangerous foes often have telegraphed attacks, and this is where the i-frame dodge comes into the combat.

This game is also a lesson in the value of polish. The music and sounds are passable, but no real draw on their own. The translation is poor, which is forgivable on its own, but adds to the pile of friction-generating elements in the game’s presentation. Skul perhaps trades polish for variety, which is often to my taste, except for the fact that the innermost game atoms are not sufficiently rewarding on their own.

Skul does offer a few interesting elements in the broader scheme of roguelike build approaches. There exist items that have an effect on their own like standard roguelike relics, but also have two additional traits. The traits can stack with others on other items, and you get additional effects at certain trait levels. As a made-up example, you might pick up an item which on its own gives you 10% faster movement and attack speed, but also carries a point in “Heirloom” and “Frenzy” traits. When you hit e.g. two “Heirloom” trait points, you get a free damage avoidance charge every 30 seconds.

There is a significant meta-progression system and it’s tied in part to overall increases in power level. This makes me feel like grinding will be required to continue progressing.

I reflected on the value of game reviews as I played this game. This game was reviewed well, and I can see why. But I also knew it wasn’t to my taste just a short while into playing. Website review systems often center around numbers where higher is better. A one through ten ranking, or a five-star system, or a simple “reviewed/recommended/essential” system. Under this system, Skul might review well. But it’s not always useful for prediction about whether I specifically will enjoy a game. I think instead of very old game review publications which would often include a review score made up of an average (potentially weighted) between several discrete factors like “gameplay, sound, music, fun.” What would the factors be if we designed them now and if they were matched to a person’s interest? Like “physical demands”, “systemic versus authored”, “puzzle versus expressive”? Or, what if we designed them around a more mature understanding of the art form as we have today, and thus a different set of factors? And what is the difference between review, and critique, and “predictive enjoyment aid”?
