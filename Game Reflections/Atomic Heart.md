WOW. The opening sequence, leading up to the title screen, was amazing. The world building was lush and creative. Hearing one character tell another that the reset code was “0451” piqued my interest. The flying city and colorful art direction put me in mind of [[BioShock Infinite]]. The music was incredible, production values very high. Writing isn't great but performance is charismatic.

I read a few reviews after playing this opening, and… I might not stick with this. I’ve got lots of great games in the queue, and I do feel like I’ve gotten 80% of the effect of the game. I don’t want to inhabit the main character and I don’t want to suffer through bad writing. But I am certainly glad I experienced the opening hour.
