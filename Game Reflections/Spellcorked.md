Attractive graphics. It's all smooth edges and fluffy font. The dialogue feels responsive because the text appears quickly. Makes excellent and varied use of the different Playdate inputs, including possibly the only pleasant accelerometer input in a game I've ever encountered.

As I’ve played a little further, it’s so far a mix of authored content and procedurally-generated. And it’s more systemic than I expected. There are interstitial exchanges between characters each day, but also a new and apparently-procedural list of potions to brew. The Grimoire is an outstanding element. It tells you everything you need to know about brewing with each ingredient. You still have to remember what each ingredient does though, and when using them for the first time, whether the desired effect is high or low. It took me several in-game days to come to grips with the system of the brewing, but I get it now.
