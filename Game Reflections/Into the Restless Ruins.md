Would have missed this without catching a review. It’s the sort of genre-blending game that’s typically catnip for me. The skill ceiling comes from developing a feel for tile placement and deck composition more than anything else. However, the game is absolutely tied together by the fact that you ultimately have to zoom in and walk your character through the structure you build. It gives an intimacy to what could have been a sterile tile placement puzzle. The action gameplay is simplistic and during those sequences the focus is more on path planning and when to tap campfires.

Completed four of six levels. Ultimately betrayed by the performance of the Switch. Stuttering frame rate with many enemies onscreen. It manifests as freeze followed by catch up meaning mobbed. Was definitely fun though I don't think the game would have lasted me much longer. It was close to finished teaching me everything it was going to teach.
