It hurts my heart to not like this game. So much care was obviously poured into it. The art is pretty, somewhere between hifi pixel and cartoon. There are a bunch of systems that intertwine in a nice way. Almost overstuffed with systems -- a full on Pokemon, card battler, procedural generation, farming, crafting, exploration and romancing game. Whew. The biggest problem is that each one of these systems is not quite delivered at the level of each of its inspirations. If you are going to have a card battling deck builder, you're going to have to suffer comparisons to [[Slay the Spire]]. Same for farming and [[Stardew Valley]]. Every single system is about 85% as good as the inspiration. That's not quite enough to gel into greatness. The ambition is clear. The execution is good. The identity is clear. But ultimately, its reach exceeds its grasp. 

I do not like how town NPCs are just front-and-centered as bags of love points waiting for you to press “flirt” enough times. Each character introduces themselves and then waits patiently on a menu for you to fill up their heart meter.

I do like the armor break system. It adds that second dimension to combat that's often needed in a turn based RPG. 

I hate the dog barking or owl hooting sound, whatever it is. It's a little too loud and plays too frequently including when there's no music at all to soften it. 

Also, and I guess this is dumb, but not being able to create my character was a big swing and miss. The character is a voiceless avatar and the game is in many ways a vehicle for expression. Having to inhabit a character I that has no real identity and yet with which I cannot identify leaves a gap. 

I HATE the one dungeon I visited. For some reason, each screen had to be traversed through portals that link to each other in unknown ways. It would be an obnoxious “puzzle” at any point in the game, but it's a baffling way to introduce the first dungeon. 

This game reminds me of [[Sagres]]. So much love and ambition let down by mechanical execution.
