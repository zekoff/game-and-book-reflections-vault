Billed as a “reverse city-builder”. It’s unusual and I probably played it on the worst platform possible in the Switch. It was clearly built for mouse and keyboard and to its credit has the complexity to benefit from it. The one decision they could have made that would have alleviated some of the control issue is make it possible to issue orders while paused. The UI still functions fully while paused, you just can’t queue or issue orders. So you feel like you’re fighting the UI and it frustrates you.

Perfectly competent in other respects. Tile upgrade system combined with the flooding of edge tiles makes you want to focus your efforts on a central hub area, while allowing you to shore up edges if necessary. The tower defense aspects were probably the wrong choice to add, since there’s already sufficient pressure from the rising tide.
