Demo version. It bears the signs I’m coming to associate with all Inti Create games which aren’t in the Azure Striker series. Combat is not fluid. Attacks are animation-based and not smoothly cancellable. Enemies exhibit the most basic of behaviors. Movement does not utilize a physics system -- no friction, no acceleration. Mobility is generally low. Jumps are tame and walking speed isn’t fast.

This game is a basic action platformer dressed as a metroidvania. Its trick is switching between characters. But that trick is poorly utilized. The deuteragonists are effectively just weapon swaps and the game freezes temporarily during the swapping animation.

One of my pet peeves in metroidvanias is when the first power is saved for a big reveal a ways into the game and it’s… a double jump. I was about an hour into the game before the double jump unlocked. That’s the moment I stopped playing.
