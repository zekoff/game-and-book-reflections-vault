Played many hours years ago. A game instance taking place in a single simulated system is an extraordinary achievement. Building and flying a rocketship to different planets is one of those “magic trick” moments where the trick is actually really good and doesn’t get old. I remember there being some sort of McGuffin hunt into the heart of each planet. That part wasn’t compelling but served its purpose to drive the game’s conclusion. If the game felt more native to console controls I’d probably play through to completion again.

One of the most powerful yet understated characteristics of the game is its minimal UI. Typically gameplay has no HUD elements at all. Oxygen, power, connections between equipment, are all represented organically in the world.
