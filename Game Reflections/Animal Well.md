I regret that I got stuck in my exploration. This is the place where the Metroidvania framework irritates me the most. You’ve got some upgrades, you know you’re missing some, you’ve explored a lot of map, and you just don’t know where to go next. You wander around and return to previous locations over and over. Slowly, your morale breaks. In the end, you give up, not because you are uninterested in what’s next, but because you don’t know how to arrive there and aren’t willing to plod across the map one more time. (Perhaps improved traversal options would have helped in this respect.)

In this game more than some, I’ve used tools in ways that better be sequence-breaking style, because they are obnoxious to execute. The two that come to mind are the slinky and the bubble wand. I triggered a floor switch using a finger-cramping combination of timed jump, slinky drop, stick-slam sprint and a just-barely-high-enough jump. The bubble wand is even worse because it’s used so frequently. You can essentially fly across any gap or climb most chutes by mashing the jump and item buttons at the same time. The bubble will disappear right as you jump, and a new will form just under you if you’re jumping to the right or left. It’s slow, frustrating, and almost reliable -- meaning you feel like you’re required to use it frequently, and yet you screw up just enough times that you sigh every time you arrive at a place where you can use it. If these uses of the tools are the expected uses, then I’m annoyed. If these are weird things I came up with because I don’t know what else to do, then I’m annoyed.

I do appreciate the sense of discovery and bewilderment that the game offers. I understand that I can’t have it both ways. Either the game lets me discover things on my own and risks my helpless wandering, or the game tells me where to go when I’m stuck and robs me of discovery. I’m not sure how I would have fixed this if I were the designer.

The lighting effects are beautiful. The game generally has a low-fi feel until every once in a while it surprises you. Firecrackers are the epitome of this. The scanline effect is very well done. In most games it feels heavy-handed. Here, though, it feels natural to the game. It’s understated and makes the game look pixelated instead of filtered. It also avoids the screen-warping that occurred on real CRTs, which is now overused as a filter.
