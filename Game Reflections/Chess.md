The theme is light but there is something there. Pawns are useful but ultimately worth a trade for pieces. Castling puts your king into a defensive position.

Playing on a chess app, there's a faint hit of "making numbers go up" -- but the number is only my player skill as rated with ELO. It is still a little compulsive. 

Based on the lessons in the app, I am starting to get a feel for opening, middlegame, and endgame. I had always heard about it but it required hands on experience to develop any intuition. 

This is like with any tabletop game. It is hard to get a feel for the mechanics until it's on on the table. MDA framework. 

I love that the state is almost entirely represented on the board. There are only two state values I can think of that aren't visible just from looking at the board. The first is whether a king or rook moved, invalidating the opportunity to castle, then moved back, making it appear is if castling was available. I imagine this is a pretty rare case in play. The other state information not on the board is whose turn it is.
