Game is about building a team of five characters, give-or-take, of various classes and equipment to auto-battle.

Making deeper progress now into a third or fourth run and I am getting a little feeling of autopilot ennui. I understand the outer resource management loop of stocking food versus investing into gear and mutations. There was also a death screen tip that helped me. It suggested a small specialized team versus a large generalist team. Makes sense. 

Won the run. Did a minor pivot on team comp near the end. In the PvP mode afterwards I placed around bottom third or at least bottom half. Clearly a lot more optimization I can learn.
