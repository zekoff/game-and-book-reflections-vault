Clearly the Playdate’s version of [[Pokemon]], at least in the ways that matter or serve my nostalgia. A collection of dozens of creatures to capture across two different versions, with the different versions having less than total overlap in available creatures. It’s a good fit for the Playdate. The sound effects are polished but unusual, the crank is used in the central (only, really) game loop, the graphics are crisp, and the theme is offbeat.

This game is the exemplar of what I think the Playdate wants to be: a hipster adult Gameboy.
