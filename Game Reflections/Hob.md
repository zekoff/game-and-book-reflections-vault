My, what a gorgeous game. It portrays scale in a way that can only be compared to the [[Xenoblade Chronicles]] games. The camera usually sits in a bird’s eye view. Occasionally though it will pan down more level with the character and show more of the world in the distance. Those moments yield incredible vistas. A sense of “what’s out there?” Clear black strokes around polygons give every image the quality of a concept art.

It’s top-down Zelda at heart. Sword and board, silent protagonist, heart containers and chopping down grass to refill them.

There is combat but it’s fiddly and perhaps even buggy. I was able to occasionally use skills that I hadn’t unlocked. The three-hit combo only triggers about two thirds of the time. Warping through enemies, a skill I did unlock, only worked about half of the time. Enemy strikes occasionally wouldn’t hit me even though their weapon passed right through me. There is a good dodge roll and it smooths over several rough edges, but overall the combat is thoroughly bad, and this is especially surprising given that Runic is best known for the [[Torchlight]] games. Platforming is similarly finicky but it too is smoothed over with a mantling move. Jumps that are slightly-missed are still recovered as the protagonist pulls himself (herself? itself?) up the ledge. The lesson here is that a safety release valve of some sort can make a system more forgiving. This is the same lesson I’ve heard applied to the [[Guilty Gear]] system -- character design can be wildly different as long as characters all share some sort of defensive escape valves.
