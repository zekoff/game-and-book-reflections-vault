The perfect tactics game. Takes place on an 8x8 grid just like [[Chess]]. It's precise, demanding, yet fully understandable at all times. Every mistake is my own fault instead of the fault of the random number generator. This is a game I've 100%'d. All achievements, all unlocks, a hundred hours or more.

One of the secret best parts of the game is the ambient story. It comes out of one-liners spoken by pilots at various times.
