As I reflected on this game for just a moment, it struck me that it hails from the autobattler genre. I haven’t played one of these recently that I can think of a lot of the game is about managing shop rerolls and merging units which scale quickly at first but slow down as you invest into them. The “one new thing” this game brings is a square X/Y grid upon which all units are placed. Positioning the units is of great importance. Units have a variety of adjacency bonuses critical to army composition. There’s a large element of balancing an army with units powerful right now versus units that will pay off later through some kind of engine building or growth.

The grid makes the game into something more special. Much of the fun comes from agonizing over placements. I’m not as intuitively familiar with this genre as I am with some others, so I still haven’t beaten a normal run despite five or so tries. I get a little better each time but there’s plenty still for the game to teach me.

I’ve had to set it aside due to yet another case of a technical issue rather than a mechanical or thematic issue. Rounds are reasonable quick (45 minutes?) and leave you with a “one more run” feeling. But the second or third run starts to add hitches between basic actions in the game. This includes the most basic of actions like flipping between unit options or moving them one cell at a time. It begins as a minor annoyance but boils by degree until I’m no longer having fun. If this is patched then I’ll be back to this game.
