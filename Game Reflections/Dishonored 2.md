One of my favorite games of all time. The addition of a second playable character with an entirely different suite of powers made for tons of replayability. I've completed the game start to finish at least four times, maybe more. My final game was a "Flesh and Steel" (no powers) "Ghost" (never detected) run. Great sandbox game as well as a great story game.
