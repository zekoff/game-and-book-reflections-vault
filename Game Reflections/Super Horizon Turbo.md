Arcade racer -- I often hear of comparisons to Sega’s OutRun in arcade racing games. That seems to be a seminal work that defined a genre. I suspect Super Horizon Turbo is in that lineage.

Well made. Polished UI. Racing is tight and cars handle differently. In general I was able to succeed in races due to my improving skills rather than improving stats. Stat boosts did exist though and I pursued those when available.

The most memorable thing is how the game handles turns. Tracks are typically very twisty. The car will auto-follow a curved track to a very slight degree. There’s no feathering the stick to lean into a turn. Turns are hard right or hard left and the way to control how you take the turn is when to release the accelerator and when to tap the break. Add into that the car’s turning characteristics and you get the primary differentiators. Car collision is the other big part of the game. Sneaking past a car on the inside of a turn is very effective. However, running into them from the back will cause you to sharply lose speed. The flipside is true. If a car is breathing down your neck you may be able to get a small boost by steering where they’ll run into you. A secondary but still important mechanic is the pickups littered along the track. There are coins which add to your campaign progression, nitro boosts which give you another boost charge, and the most surprising which are fuel tanks. Your car can and will run out of fuel before the race is over if you don’t manage your fuel pickups. I ultimately liked this after the shock wore off. It forces you to remember pickup locations on the track and to occasionally take sub-optimal racing lines or give up an advantage so that you can grab fuel before you run dry.
