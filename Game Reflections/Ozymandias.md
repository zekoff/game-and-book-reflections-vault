Does a lot with a little. Two unit types, linear improvements to cities, a handful of tile types. The most flexible and expressive system is the research system. Time per turn is spent about equally between studying the map, moving units or placing flags, and adjusting spending in the wealth tab.

Compresses 50% of a game of [[Civilization series]] into 5% of the time.

I originally turned my nose up at the fact that maps are pre-made instead of procedurally generated. I have since come around to them. Maps actually resemble the real-life locations that they’re based on. I was struck in the Mediterranean map when I saw Italy’s boot and then noticed the verisimilitude of culture placement on that map. The real value though comes from the fact that each culture’s placement is a static starting position and will give a different play experience even on the same map. This is contrary to my normal leaning of wanting nearly everything procedurally generated.

The entire map can fit visibly on the screen when zoomed out. There is a balance of hidden information and revealed. Civ economies and upcoming actions are hidden but their armies, borders, city sizes, and civ specialties are all visible. The different civ specialities are implemented by giving specific bonuses and penalties to different facets of their economy. They then get labeled as “Militant”, “Expansionist”, etc. This gives a nice prod towards how to be successful with that civ on a given map. Civs are rated by how difficult it will be to succeed with them on a map.

As a surprise, it also has touch controls!

Impressive game. The sort of game that I’d like to have made.

At the end of each game. A narrator recites the last lines from the poem Ozymandias. Whether intentional or not, a reflection upon the fleeting nature of that victory, I simply press main menu and my entire civilization disappears in a puff of ones and zeros.
