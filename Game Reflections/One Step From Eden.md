Probably a few total hours across less than 10 runs. The meta progression elements are light, and center around an expanding pool of options rather than upgrades in power. That is my personal preference in roguelikes. I need to go back and remind myself of the battle system in [[MegaMan Battle Network]], as I’ve heard this game described as having lifted the core battle system wholesale. If so, then MMBN was an impressive achievement and likely before its time in some ways.

The music in the game stands out.

There is too much emphasis on twitch reflexes for my taste. I’ve seen the game given negative marks for its high difficulty. The game is difficult, but it’s the sort of difficulty that requires mastery from the player, rather than grinding to increase stats. As my mastery has increased, my progress through each run has also increased. However, later stages seem to scale the reflex-based difficulty linearly. I’ve made it as far as perhaps world four or five of maybe eight, and I don’t think I have the physical dexterity to make it all the way. I certainly can improve in understanding deck composition and building the deck, but that won’t necessarily stop damage -- damage mitigation primarily comes from avoiding attacks, which requires split-second reflexes in addition to learning enemy patterns. Learning the patterns is something I’m enjoying mastering. Reflexes are something I’ll encounter a personal ceiling on at some point.

However, I don’t think I’m quite ready to set this aside yet. There seems to be a few more nooks and crannies I want to explore before I’m ready to chalk my remaining failures up to reflexes.

Really appreciate that there is no direct power increase in the meta progression. That is probably the single driving factor that brought me back to the game over and over -- I knew it was me getting better, not a stat going up between runs. I finally made it to the last area. One Step from Eden, as it were. This is where I lost and deleted the game, not out of frustration, but out of a feeling that my twitch skills were not up to the challenge ahead.
