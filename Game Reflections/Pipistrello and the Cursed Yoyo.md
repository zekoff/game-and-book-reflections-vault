Captures the GBA aesthetic perfectly. Movement is in 4 directions and pressing two at once means you move at full speed along each axis. There is no diagonal attacking. Sprites are large, pixelated, and use a constrained color palette. The game is twitch-based enough that I have to be choosy about whether I’ll play it. Because the artistic trappings didn’t click with me, I won’t buy it, but I'm very impressed and would almost purchase it just to support the developer.

I did like the way I unlocked new abilities and what they could do for me. It is a self-described “yoyo-vania” (referencing the protagonist’s primary weapon and tool) so I assume there would be many more upgrades in store for me. I love seeing creativity with Metroidvania abilities.
