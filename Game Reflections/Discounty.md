Demo version. [[Stardew Valley]] vibes. Chunky pixel characters. Tool belt at bottom of screen. Tile aligned things to pick up and put down that plop and make suction noises and tween-wobble. Also [[Earthbound]]. Irreverent but not condescending dialogue. Zoomed in camera with a big focus on buildings and cute details.

Highly tutorizaled. The game reminded me with dialogue where I was going after transitioning from one screen to another. Doesn't trust me very much which implies it will be an on rails experience. 

Very neat that running the cash register means literally adding up the prices of items as customers bring them to you. I haven't seen this mechanism since [[Math Blaster]]. I like it in theory, hard to say if I'll still like it hours from now. 

Dangles a little mystery early on with an abandoned (?) building from which noises come, or from a closed off forest path with radioactive signs. 

Playing with the layout of the shop was something I stumbled upon without a tutorial although I have utter confidence it will be tutorialized later. I could see that being fun. There's a real time element of needing to run back and forth from the cash register and restock. That'll be a place for expansion and upgrades to come in. There are adjacency bonuses already showing up with an aquarium adding appeal to nearby fish stick stock. And time before and after the work day to go around town or crucially to play with shop layout. 

I was prepared to be dismissive of this game but I think they have something here. I don't know if I'll take the plunge but this is more impressive than I thought it would be.
