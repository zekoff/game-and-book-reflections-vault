[[Vampire Survivors|VS]]-like which I bought at heavy discount (~$2?) because I’d heard its name and wanted to analyze it. Its differentiators are:

- Guns are fired based on button press, and slow the player while firing.
- Twin-stick aiming is required. (There is an option to simply auto-target the closest enemy, but the game is not set up where this is a viable way to play outside perhaps of certain builds which I never encountered. Either way, the game is effectively a twin-stick shooter.)
- Some characters have activated special abilities.
- Upgrade system is different. You can have multiple copies of the same upgrades but there are no weapon evolutions. Occasionally you will be granted a choice of major perk.

The twin-stick aiming and requirement for a manual button press to shoot bring this pretty far out of line with VS. The tradeoffs:

- Manual shooting expands the design space. The character moves slower while shooting. This offers some space to play off of with powerups and encounter mix. Enemies approach the player but don’t track perfectly which means you can stop firing to sneak out of an encirclement. There are also some perks that improve the speed you move while shooting.
- Twin stick-aiming also expands the space for encounter design. There can be times when a mix of enemies means it’s wise to shoot your way past a clump of weaklings and then turn your aim back to the bigs. Or times where you want to keep you back clear as an escape route and so you occasionally flick your aim behind you.
- Both of these things dramatically change one of the things that makes VS itself special. VS milks an incredible amount of gameplay out of just a thumbstick. Seeing the infinite waves and knowing all you have to do is move gives the game its hypnotic quality. The focus is almost entirely on the build. Moment-to-moment gameplay is very simple. Here instead, moment-to-moment gameplay is more stressful. You can fail either because your perks don’t fit together or because you failed at the twin-stick shooting game. On the other hand, if VS is too auto-battley for you, the twin-stick approach would be more desirable.
- The upgrade system is noisier than VS. Here the “breaking the game” part comes from getting multiple copies of perks that perfectly fit your build, rather than getting weapon evolutions. There’s a higher likelihood of having to pick garbage perks that don’t fit at all. On the other hand, picking the same desirable perk more than once offsets that. Since you simply have perks each level up rather than a small set of items you soup up, you end a run with dozens and dozens of perks. The downside of this approach is that it’s very hard to keep track of what you’ve actually selected previously. The upside is that it lends a more intuitive flavor. “I think I picked up some burn perks 10 minutes ago, maybe I can wrangle a burn/freeze build out of this set of picks.”  

One of the key elements of both the games is being able to parse visual noise. Here the enemy ranged attacks are highlighted red which stands out to the monochrome of every other part of the chaos. However, it weakens the ability to read your own powers a bit and takes away some of that joy. If I get the perk where all my bullets split into more bullets, do I just see bullets or is that XP on the ground or is it bits of the enemy sprites, etc.

There’s some metaprogression and a number of characters and starting weapons to unlock. Both the characters and the starting weapons are ultimately just tweaks on starting conditions and things to begin crafting a build around. By the end of a run the character is completely defined by the perks selected over the course of the run.

Ultimately, if I have to boil it down to something binary: this is a twin-stick shooter inspired by VS, rather than a VS-like with twin-stick shooting.
