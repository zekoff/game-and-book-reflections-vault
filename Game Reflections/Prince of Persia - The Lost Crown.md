Incredible art style. The characters all look like badasses, and the art style is that cleanly-textured look I remember from [[Darksiders]]. Watercolor? There is a dedication to flair in the animations, and the voice acting is excellent. Sargon is established right from the beginning as a capable hero, and I’m interested to see how much further he’ll grow. The Immortals were spoiled in a review of the game as ending up being villains, which is not telegraphed at the beginning of the game. In fact, I’m almost dreading seeing them turn, because each of them is charismatic in their own way.

The gameplay is smooth. The combat is fast but not frantic. Enemies can soak a good bit of damage. The three-hit combo has become a bit repetitive at this early stage, but you can mix it up with charged attacks mid-combo, and with high and low attacks which aren’t tutorialized. The demo was interesting in that it was clearly custom-crafted. It gave me a lot of toys which I’m missing now that I’m into the game proper.

I also note that the demo was not simply the opening sequence of the game, so the opening sequence was a surprise. There was a compelling (and surprisingly violent) opening movie showing a losing battle against invaders, whereupon the Immortals enter the scene like an anime superhero team and turn the tide.

Colorful versus dour browns. Mark of current style. [[Mario Wonder]].

Amazing game. Played to completion and loved it. Shockingly emotional, on par with a [[Xenoblade]] game. Screenshots and videos.

This is why I fell in love with games. The story told with the game. More than just gameplay, more than just script. Why RPG maker ignited my imagination, because I could tell an amazing story with a game that gave me emotions.
