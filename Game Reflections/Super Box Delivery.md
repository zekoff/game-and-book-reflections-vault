Infinite runner framed as a driving game. Lane based pickups as in something like Subway Surfers but differs in that the car is driven freely across the road. It can shade itself between lanes or only barely into a target lane. This can be paired with the generous time dilation and allow for intentional near misses to grab special boxes or to build the meter which allows time dilation. 

Has a definite one more run feel. At the beginning of each run there is a camera zoom animation lasting a few seconds. It breaks up the pace quite a bit since you will almost certainly have lost the precious run at high speed. It felt jarring and pace killing until now I reflect on it. It is actually sensible to change the pace. Otherwise it just goes from intensity to intensity with no build up. This also serves as a foil for the high speed that will come later in the run. 

Small tweak to the formula is that the score does not increase until you bank your score at a checkpoint. Push your luck as you decide whether you can risk pushing on to the next one. But the speed does slow down when you bank things so you get a little bit of a second lease on life.
