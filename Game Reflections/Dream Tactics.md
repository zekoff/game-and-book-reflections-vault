Another game, like [[Unicorn Overlord]], which places the tactical fights directly on the map where you are walking around.

Highly playable and fairly easy to onboard the player even with a limited tutorial. Snappy interface. No friction from the UI when performing actions. No delays when entering commands due to performance issues or from forcing you to sit through graphical flourishes. The graphics are fairly spartan but it works.

Three things so far that are notable. One button press activates an glossary. And concept in the UI can be selected to learn more about it. Buffs and debuffs,character stats. Tremendous aid to onboarding. Second, gear is equipped based on gear points not slots. If you have enough read gear points to equip three swords, go for it. Gear points increase with character level. Third, cards that belong to other characters can be slotted into a different characters deck. This is limited by a party wide resource. Allows synergy and mix n match.

It feels like it's missing some sort of wrinkle. The thing I thought of first was a way to prepare for battles based on terrain. The fact that battles occur on the main terrain is squandered because all you can do is walk into the battle while exploring. But then I thought too that Unicorn Overlord is the same. Despite battles occurring in the world map, you can prepare the terrain for those either. You can definitely utilize the terrain during battle though. In DT tiles are either accessible or not. It contributes to the battles feeling non tactical overall. The game is in deck building really. The benefit of that is that it doesn't insert double randomness where your draw is random and the terrain is random. But cards not interacting with terrain at all feels weird.

It's a faithful GBA experience of not being able to prepare terrain and just walking into a battle. But also [[Advance Wars]] had points of interest (forts), unit production, and meaningful terrain. 

Basically the deck building and equipment are neat and there's even some real gameplay in optimizing them. Otherwise it feels like something is missing though. Maybe it's the enemy types or objectives then. There are definitely different enemies but they just boil down to walking up and hurting you, maybe from a couple of tiles away. And every battle so far has been just an exterminate mission. The only exception being sub objectives to open chests in a certain number of turns. Those timers have been so generous as to be irrelevant though.

The characters feature nice artwork. The dialogue is like Frozen’s Anna in the sense of it's fantasy girls being “cute but real”. It's fine. It is weird how actually and self-admittedly bloodthirsty The gang of protagonists is. The whole game isn't unpleasant, it's even mildly diverting, but I am not sure what makes this special.
