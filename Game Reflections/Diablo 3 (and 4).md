Picked up the heavily-discounted Switch port after hearing my brother remark how he’s still playing it and has for years. Timely also after reading Jason Schreier’s [[Play Nice]], a timeline of the rise and (perhaps exaggerated) fall of Blizzard.

There’s a reason this game is still selling after more than a decade. It’s the king of ARPGs because it’s polished to a mirror shine. \[I have played an hour or two of Diablo 4, so it should be reflected in this log, but it’s not.\] Diablo 4 is so steeped in evil that it overwhelms me. There’s nothing too gruesome for Diablo 4. It positively revels in rot, corruption, viscera, demonology, occult symbology. Diablo 3 is not Candyland, but it’s only a 10 on the Hell Index, as opposed to Diablo 4 which is a 13. A 10 is nearly more than I want to put up with but I can stomach it. 13 is too much.

I also in hindsight approached Diablo 4 the wrong way. It’s an online ARPG. Diablo 3 is an ARPG designed to be played online. The critical difference is that it’s possible to opt out of the online elements of Diablo 3. Diablo 4 offers no such option. The deathblow for Diablo 4 came when I started having lag on basic attacks in my single-player mode. As I recall, I gave it one more try after that, and upon running into that problem again, I’ve never returned.
