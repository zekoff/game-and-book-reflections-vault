Very faithful to what I know of the original. Flippable in game instruction manual set a nice tone. Brutally hard as is legend. Also… kind of boring. The genre has benefitted from extensive iteration. Uses a tile set that I've never seen before but otherwise looks like a straight port. Unfortunately, the input scheme and screen size makes it very difficult to play. This is a core issue with traditional rogue likes. (Which is of course true of Rogue!) 8-way movement is critical if the game is designed around it. That's tough to guarantee as reliable, discrete inputs on a joystick. And for a game like this where a single false step will literally end your run, it just can't work as an experience.

Cruel, as I've known intellectually for years, but am so glad I got to experience. I've been trained well in playing the descendants of this game, and those skills translated well. My most successful run ended when I was use-IDing a wand. It was a wand of bolt which killed me instantly. In a game where I didn't spend so much time fighting the interface I'd have just jumped back in, because this was enjoyable. I've gotten enough from it though. 

I read something a while back saying something along the lines of: “You can't play every classic game. But as a student of the form, what you can do is play one or two hours of most of them. It's way, way better than none at all.” From that standpoint, I couldn't be more happy that I got a chance to do this.
