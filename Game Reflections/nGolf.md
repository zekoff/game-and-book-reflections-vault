Bought on a whim for $3 for Switch. Just a time-passer. Appears to have 8 courses w/ 8 holes each. Each course takes just a few minutes. Grand total of less than an hour playtime. Graphics and UI are clean, shot mechanic is basic and passable, music and sound effects are mildly pleasant background noise. No load times to speak of, just blaze through. Probably not worth $3… which is bananas. Twenty years ago, if this were given freely on the Internet, it would have taken the world by storm, like [[Elf Bowling]]. It probably still has a niche -- appears to be sharply discounted on the eShop, although its current sale price is a good match to its value. I bet it will make more than what was spent to make it.
