Slick production value right out of the gate. Threshold for good games is so high now. I missed this completely and I keep a close pulse on games.

Tactical situation generator. Room based combat rogue like. Takes more inspiration from modern rogue likes due to emphasis on relics. Differentiating feature seems to be weapon use. One weapon for each cardinal direction, triggered by bump combat.

Like crown trick. Its all about rooms as tactical challenges, unique weapons that define the character. [[Crown Trick]]’s systems have two advantages. First, having a more limited weapon select narrows the scope and the possible choices for each move. This makes the game flow more smoothly and better matches the number of variables to keep in your head at once. Second, Crown Trick’s rooms are generally larger and thus less crowded. Movement becomes tactical instead of puzzle-like.

The fact that ranged weapons prevent movement is a continual source of irritating surprise. Many, many times, I intend to move in a direction to avoid an attack, but because I have a ranged weapon in that directional slot and there’s a junk tile in range, I’ll strike the junk tile instead of moving and then get hit by an attack. There’s a dedicated button to avoid this behavior. However, because I have to juggle multiple weapon types in my head just to move, I’m more likely to forget the parameters of any one movement direction. What I ought to do instead is hold the force-move button anytime I’m intentionally trying to move out of an attack zone. Then I won’t have to remember which weapon is where. But that means I have to re-learn how to move. Not a good solution either. There’s a little flavor of “design edge cases out of the game” here. Is the fussiness of this system worth the gameplay space it offers? Ranged weapons are the culprit. However, removing all ranged weapons would dramatically shrink the options. It’s more compatible with bump combat however. In classical roguelikes, ranged attacks are almost always dedicated to a different input, and work differently as well.

Translation barrier reveals itself over time. First revealed in some tutorial messages that were incomplete or flat-out wrong. Now it shows up in dialogue that doesn’t quite hold together.

Definitely opens up once you have teleport and chips. Teleport is a straightforward get out of jail card. Chips are more interesting. Perform a DDR movement sequence to trigger a special ability. 

Can contribute upgrade tokens to one of two characters with upgrade trees. Says it affects the ending.

Little bit of [[Megaman X]]. Little bit of [[Crypt of the Necrodancer]]. Slay the Spire brought in the modern relic hunt. Relic upgrades are satisfying because they're significant. Tremendous improvement in one relic while paying the opportunity cost of passing up all the others.

Significant power growth by spending the metaprogression currency. Impractical to get further without it. Mixed feelings. 

Building Blocks of Digital Game Design?

Degenerate strategy if you have first aid chip. Just leave one easy enemy alive and kill time till you can cast first aid enough to full heal.

Game was much harder before the unlock of teleport and chips first aid. Inverse difficulty spike. Now in the second poison world, the stages are extremely cramped, which limits use of chips, and overfull with enemies, which makes each room rely on dancing and teleport. Poison is an ever present threat and the immunity power is either bugged or underwhelming. Even an immunity build doesn’t seem to make a difference.

Combat feels flat. No exploration or puzzles or inventory, only combat. Bump combat is not engaging. It is simple which is good. But not the right choice for a game that is only about combat. Relics are either direct combat benefits or a small few that are indirect combat benefits like getting gold. Reroll system and weapon upgrade are fine but again feed only into combat. Light movement puzzles from enemy markers. But generally these puzzles only get thorny when there are many enemies and then they simultaneously neuter your ability to project damage or control which slows things down and feels annoying.

Are the aesthetics mismatched or disjointed? You are ostensibly diving into the hell analog yet the characters look like smiley animes. In fact, the big boss wears a deer hat or a deer helmet. The computer that you speak with throughout the game uses copious ASCII arts in line and various internet phrasings. The gritty hell diver aesthetic is already used often, but hell and gritty seriousness go together. The dialogue is setting up for a significant reveal and associated emotional arc. The characters will be not what they first appear, and you’ll see both the virtue and the evil in both of them. Perhaps neither -- they simply have competing viewpoints and won’t compromise. That arc is valid. The barrier in this case may be a translation problem. It lands the story in an uncanny valley. I wonder if progressing in
