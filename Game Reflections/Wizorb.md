Purchased it because it was cheap ($2.50) and made by Tribute, who’s done great work in other games. This is apparently one of their earlier efforts. It’s another one of those games that I myself might have made. I feels like an XBLA game that’s simply been ported to Switch. A reminder of a simpler time. The core [[Breakout]] mechanics are as fun as they’ve always been, and the difficulty via gradually increasing speed of the ball is tuned well so that it’s not trivial. It’s still quite difficult to target with the paddle. The spells should alleviate this (like the fireball that ostensibly could be used to destroy the last couple of annoying bricks in many levels). But magic power is surprisingly limited and does not regenerate automatically, so the spells become an unreliable oddity rather than a core mechanic of the game. I would have preferred regenerating magic to make spell casting more reliable. This game suffers from the core Breakout problem of the first third of the each level being a fun series of explosions, the middle third being an uneven experience between empty spaces and still-clogged areas, and the final third of each level being an irritating hunt for a couple of remaining bricks.

I actually addressed this issue cleverly in 1GAM 2023 [Zoo Escape](https://zekoff.com/zoo-escape), where you complete a level by simply bashing an opening to the top of the level. You get to enjoy the “first third” of each level as described above, then you win.
