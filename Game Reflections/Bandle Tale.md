The character movement is off-putting -- it seems weirdly physics-based, with the character struggling up inclines and generally having too much inertia. There’s also an extraordinarily heavy emphasis on dialogue instead of the systemic underpinnings. Hours in, I still feel like I’m in the world’s most boring tutorial. The cutesy characters aren’t quite charming me, and the writing breaks the fourth wall occasionally but does so by substituting generic sarcasm or context-free social commentary for well-conceived jokes or character development. For a game that ended up relying so heavily on dialogue and quests, those things are simply not compelling enough to get me invested.
