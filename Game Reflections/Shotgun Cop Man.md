Demo version. Wow. Attack and movement come from the same action. Always love that because you must sometimes choose between one or the other and you sometimes get to benefit from both in a single action. Smooth, physics-based action. The room for skill growth is obvious. Accessibility options include a simple bar to dial down the game speed. Magnificent! I could see dialing down the speed to 80% and having a blast with this game.

Purchased full version for cheap. It was as expected. After the novelty wore off I wasn't as interested. It's well crafted and full of creative stages. The biggest problem for me was hand pain from playing. Dropping down to 75% speed did help. It also made me more successful and felt better. I couldn't overcome the hand fatigue though so had to stop.
