I have never really liked DKC. [[Super Mario Bros. series|Mario]] is the standard platformer at this point so it may just be by comparison. DKC’s hitboxes seem very slightly unpredictable compared to Mario’s. That’s actually all I can think of. The approach to collectibles is roughly the same. Coins are bananas and K-O-N-G is Dragon Coins. DKC actually adds a riff by including frequent secrets with light minigames within stages. Perhaps it is simply a lack of familiarity as well as a mild dislike for the gorilla and jungle theme.
