First level was fairly basic. Competent first-person action game. Then you get thrown a suite of powers in the second level and it feels like [[Dishonored]] again suddenly. The place-and-activate movement instead of Blink is off-putting and changes the flow of the game more than you think it would. But the regenerating approach to magic power is a dramatic improvement over Dishonored 1 and 2.

I may not end up completing this game, for a reason that surprises me -- I’m tired of spending time in this world. It’s grim, morally bankrupt, often disgusting. The hook is very intriguing (killing The Outsider, the source of so much pain in the world as well as the gift and curse that fuels 1 and 2). But, the key characters are not people I want to spend time with either. Daud has such a checkered past but not someone I want to be around. Meghan Foster / Bille Lurk is a non-entity. Her character design is attention-getting but I don’t remember her role in Dishonored 2 and “Daud’s disciple” isn’t enough without a stronger connection to Daud. As for the world itself, the novelty is now gone after Dishonored 1 and 2, and there’s only so many rats, bloodflies, corpses, and edgy characters I can handle now.
