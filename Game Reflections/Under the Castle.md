Recalls [[Crypt of the Necrodancer]] because of the way the enemies move. They follow predictable patterns that update on each movement. The predictability adds a puzzle-like element. There is enough crunchiness in status and item pickups that it feels more freeform than a puzzle. There’s also some push-your-luck because things get quickly harder the further you descend, but you have to go down far enough to complete your quest.**
