A “game” only in the sense that [[Mario Paint]] for SNES was a game. To me, Boogie Loops is a cute, less-useable version of [BeepBox](https://www.beepbox.co/). It’s neat that it exists on the Playdate. I can definitely see some people sinking their teeth into the challenge of creating compelling tunes. (If there were a way to download others’ creations, I’d check it out.) I don’t plan to mess around much more with this, myself.

The animations of the creatures, and the selection of creatures (like a piece of pizza) certainly fit the emerging aesthetic of the Playdate. Somewhere between cute, edgy, and off-kilter.
