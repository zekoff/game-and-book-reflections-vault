I am experiencing some genre fatigue. Relics are really the focal point -- I tire of having to cross-reference fifteen additional icons somewhere else in the UI to remember how to optimize my turn.

Lonestar itself does one central thing well and then introduces a new tweak on something else. Its central mechanism is the building of a spaceship using up to nine different Units. Units define the attack and utility capabilities of the ship. The nine slots are available in a 3x3 grid where adjacency matters for many of the Unit types. This is a fun organizing puzzle. In addition to optimizing the grid, shots are traded in up to five horizontal rows between player and enemy. Placing units to give adequate coverage in all rows is part of the decision. This is very similar to the concept of lanes in other games.

The minor tweak is on the way Energy is doled out to power Units. Think of a playing card. The player has one set of colored backgrounds defining the power class of a card, and a different set of numbers. The power class and numeric values are drawn and combined to create an Energy token.

It’s a little convoluted but it’s also threaded into the way Units can be built and into run progression elements. It ultimately does pay back its cost in cognitive load because it allows for variation in equipment.

I’m reflecting on the amount of randomness in the game. The two sources of randomness on your turn are the enemy intent and the Energy you draw. Enemy intents are random and hidden per turn but completely exposed once the turn is set. Energy card draws feel quite random but actually they are more controlled than I was initially going to give them credit for. A button in the UI allows you to see what from your quasi-deck has been drawn/used. It would be possible to hedge bets based on what cards are likely to be drawn in the next turn.

The difficulty is tuned a little high but I appreciate it. Losing motivated me to jump back in and try again. There is a small amount of metaprogression power increase, but the way to become more successful in the game is very clearly to learn, not to grind.

It’s a well-crafted game.
