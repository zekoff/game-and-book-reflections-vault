Picked up from Playdate’s “best of 2023” list. Very cute, and well-made. Owes a great debt, certainly, to Ridiculous Fishing. The crank is of course the ultimate input for a fishing game. However, so far everything that can be done with the crank can also be done with the D-pad. It turns out that I like this. The crank is there when you want the full Playdate experience, and the D-pad alone is there when you want to pull the Playdate out of your pocket for a quick cast and a one-handed session.

I couldn’t find my way out of the tutorial area for a few casts, until I poked around and selected a place to travel to on the world map. This isn’t the first time I’ve experienced this on the Playdate. There’s often so little tutorialization that it ends up enhancing the sense of discovery. A surprising thread to be shared between games. With this one in particular, it is slightly odd that the game dumps you into a tutorial area and then fails to tutorialize a critical element of moving on.
