An EULA to start a single player game. Not an auspicious beginning. A weird flash then the word "Gloomtown" with tentacles. Tiny font in handheld indicative of a sub-standard Switch port. The stats are Smarts, Charm, Guts, Proficiency. I do have fond memories of something similar with [[Kingdom of Loathing]] (Muscle, Mysticality, Moxie). Lovely UI. Input lag when walking -- unforgiveable. Lots of cursing.

Bounced.
