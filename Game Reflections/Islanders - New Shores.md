Very little raison-d’etre compared to the original [[Islanders]]. There is some light carryover between islands now and the Boons can tweak the way that islands are built. The expansion into more fantasy islands is also different. It makes the game less cohesive though. This trade-off didn’t work for me. If I’d come to this one without playing the original I might have liked it better.
