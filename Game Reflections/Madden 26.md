This game is not what I expected or wanted. I was hoping for a football game to help me recollect my knowledge of the X’s and O’s of football. This game is more of a companion app for an NFL season. It’s the product of year after year of iteration on a particular formula. Because I’m coming in essentially cold, I had trouble even finding a foothold to understand it. Controlling the quarterback requires a level of physical execution and familiarity with the controls that I simply won’t put in the time to master. I’d have many, many hours ahead of coming to grips with the controls. Only once I got past that would I achieve my actual desire which is to focus on the playcalling. What I really was looking for was a game where I could call plays, make reads, and then turn my read into action. I am not sure how any game would truly achieve that. Perhaps a touch-control game or a game where each key player was mapped to a button. Pressing the button would communicate my intent and I would trust the game to attempt to carry out my intent.

The crowd sound and color commentary was amazing. Even despite the poor performance of the game on Switch 2, the camera work, sound, and animation transported me to watching an NFL gameday on TV. A reminder here though that digital games always have the technical component. Failed technical achievement can produce a game whose reach exceeds its grasp. Incredible job capturing the spectacle of an NFL game. It does remind me that I am firmly in the college football camp rather than NFL. 

The level of intricacy in controls and sophistication in game modes required to play and appreciate this game show how it is catering to a core audience. That audience needs more and new each year to justify a purchase. I am seeing the result of a product which has accreted features for many years. Perhaps a blank slate approach would be useful for this franchise. Spin off a sister series that starts where Retro Bowl ends.
