A stunning game and the gold standard for depth in automation games. It's incredibly complex and unwieldy. My greatest moment of disappointment was when I realized that certain parts of the game are "solved". Lay out this blueprint just so, connect these things together... but I'd never have arrived at those things by myself.

I'd prefer a game where the complexity was a bit less but the terrain mattered more. It would disrupt the ability to plop down optimal blueprints (meaning, for me, that it eliminates the need to look things up online).

I also didn't connect with the tower defense element. It's tension that is very important since the game needs to push back in some way. But I always hated watching my beautiful work be destroyed.
