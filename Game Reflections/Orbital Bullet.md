Missed opportunity. Very broadly it’s an action platformer roguelite. The game is not without merit. Its USP is that stages are arranged as loops around a central pillar and each loop has both an inner and an outer ring which you can flip between at certain jump points. The inner-outer ring mechanism is used at times when enemies can fire at you between rings even though you can’t fire back at them. The other looping mechanic, which you’d think would be central to the game, is essentially just a visual trick. There’s no enemy or power design which makes use of the loop. This being the game’s thesis statement, it’s underutilized to the point that it’s actually disappointing.

Collision is dicey in the game which is a critical failure. I’d probably have stuck with the game a little longer if the moment-to-moment action had been tighter. As it is, I saw it through enough to unlock two of the metaprogression systems. Those systems as well as the in-stage “perk” system are underwhelming. As an example, you can spend one of your very limited character progression tokens to unlock something like a 10% improvement to a single class’s special utility move. The worst of both worlds sort of progression. Both stingy and meaningless.

I’d have leaned more into what makes this game special. The levels based around loops. And I’d have frontloaded that content. Make it so you can’t pass the tutorial without engaging with something central about the game. Have bullet types that go straight through the cylinder and enemies which are only vulnerable on their side facing into the pillar. Allow free jumping between the inner and outer rings. Make all bullets circle completely around the loop by default. Add ways of manipulating the way two vertical loops are aligned with one another. Those are just off the top of my head. Basically, the central hook is halfway to a puzzle game. Make the action more puzzle-like. If that is a different game and it’s ultimately too complex to make an action game, then either re-imagine it or accept that this game is only differentiated by its presentation.

And maybe that’s my problem. I expected there to be gameplay differentiation based on the central hook. Instead the game could be functional presented instead as simply a standard 2D platformer stage where the edges wrap around.
