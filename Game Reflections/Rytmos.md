Neat, but I don’t feel like I “got it”. I get the puzzle solving -- it’s a pretty standard setup. The fundamental action is line-drawing to connect locations, and some of the puzzle worlds have unique challenges like tiles that move with the beat, or puzzles that wrap around to multiple boards. The puzzling itself is fine. Not exactly my cup of tea, but that’s more about me than the game. They are serviceable puzzles. What I’m missing is an attachment to the real hook of the game, which is that ostensibly you’re crafting musical tracks by completing the puzzles. I certainly don’t feel like there’s expressiveness in how to solve the puzzles and therefore create the music myself. Once I found a solution, I basically moved on with relief. (You can solve the puzzles with less than a perfect approach, but I never did. I always worked on each puzzle until I found the optimal solution hitting all of the target locations.) The music is “world music”, so various different styles from different eras. To my pedestrian sensibilities, I couldn’t really appreciate the styles. I had a brief moment of “that’s neat” as I heard the general style of each new world, and then it was just background noise while I worked on the puzzles. I think of Raph Koster and how he describes jazz, that it’s just noise until the moment you “get it”. Well, I never “got” any of the styles in this game, nor did I perceive the connective tissue that I assume binds the styles all together in the minds of the development team.
