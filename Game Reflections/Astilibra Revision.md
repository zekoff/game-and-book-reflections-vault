The recommended “Demo” opener was a wise choice. My intuition is that the combat is polished in a way that matters many hours in, even though the surface level is rough. The enemies have few animations and do not interfere with moving the player. Yet there is hitstun and particle effects with each strike, the ability to chain combos, a wealth of stats and skill points to allocate. This is a game made for the 50 hour mark, not the 5-minute mark. Having a custom-crafted demo to show you what the game is like deep in was a smart move. I am right now playing through the true story opening and there has been about 10 minutes so far of static in-engine cutscenes, text boxes, and moving left and right. Certainly a less compelling opener than the demo mode.

In the scene I’m in now, the character as a child is simply walking from the left side of the screen to the right. The sprites never change but the coloring to indicate time of day, and the sound effects, change with each repeated screen. This is the idea of “closure” from [[Understanding Comics]]. As the reader, I understand that time is passing each time the panel advances, even though that’s in no way made explicit on the screen.

A few more hours in, and I’m finished with the prologue and have unlocked every major (e.g. “menu item”) mechanic in the game. It’s a pretty standard suite with the exception of the Scales of Libra (or something like that). It’s a perk/powerup system stylized as a pair of scales, as in the tool a classical merchant might use to weigh one thing against another. Often associated with justice. Each side of the scale has a pan upon which you can place any inventory item. Every single item in the game has a “karma” weight and one or more bonuses. You get whatever bonuses are associated with whatever items you put on each side of the scale, with a couple of constraints:

- If the same bonus is present on both sides of the scale, the bonus does not activate. So, if the left item has an “Attack Up” bonus and the right side has an “Attack Up” bonus, the bonus does not activate at all.
    
- The strength of the active bonuses depends on how evenly-balanced the scales are. If the scales are perfectly balanced, the same karmic weight on both sides, the bonus amounts are at 100%. If the scale tips in either direction, all the bonuses are reduced proportionally to how tipped the scales are.
    

It’s clearly signaled that additional plates for slotting items will be unlocked as the game progresses. What a neat system! I expect it to tie into the story in some significant way, although I am toying with the idea of skipping story cutscenes from here on out. And, it is an implementation of a vague idea I’ve had floating around for years related to a system where a balance between two sides is important, rather than just min-maxing one side of a spectrum or the other. I also love the idea of items having bonuses only for use on these scales. Even if the item is otherwise useless, or maybe outclassed because it’s an early-game item, it might have a use on the scale because it has good bonuses, or because it has exactly the right karma value to balance the scales. So you get more mileage out of every inventory item. Huge design space for both the designer and the player to explore.

Fun small tidbit, the use of magic skills is triggered via time-paused button press and some skill slots require sequential presses of two different directions, like left-down, or up-up. This is a neat way to bring in an input system similar to [[Street Fighter]] joystick inputs, where you can do a Fireball QCF and get the skill in that slot, even though the game is paused while you are inputting the buttons. On higher difficulties I see that the game actually disables that pause feature so you’d almost have to do the fighting game style approach.
