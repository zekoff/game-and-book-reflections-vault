First-person shooter roguelike. Basically, Borderlands in roguelike format. There is a hub area with metaprogression. The metaprogression includes both new options as well as straight power increases. The innermost game loop of movement and shooting is simple but satisfying. The game is informed by the twitchy breed of FPSes, like [[Doom - The Dark Ages|Doom: The Dark Ages]], where movement is the primary form of defense. Enemies have nice variation between damage sponges and gnats, leading to intuitive target prioritization gameplay.
