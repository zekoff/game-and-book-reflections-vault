Played about an hour or two on Switch. This game was reviewed well, and even though I was skeptical, I picked it up on sale. It has the chunky-tiled, natural and biological trappings of the original [[Metroid]] artistically, but the way the game feels is more like… [[Ghosts and Goblins]]? It doesn’t trap you into the momentum of a jump the way GnG does, but the jumps do feel deliberate and without finesse.

The most unusual choice is that when the character’s bullet strikes an enemy, it causes knockback to the character, and not the enemy. This not only makes the gun feel anemic, it saps the feeling of offensive momentum, since one of the riskiest things you can do is try and deal damage. The game is generous with deadly spike pits and with one-tile-wide platforms, so knockback is very annoying. It also makes absolutely no sense physically. It’s not every shot that causes knockback, it’s only the shots that connect. I do appreciate the “Sparkblood” mechanic, where every successful hit on an enemy charges a syringe of Sparkblood, which can be injected with a button press to heal one of your very limited hit points.

There’s also a needless mechanic where dying warps you back to a save point but also causes you to lose a maximum hit point until you return to the location you died. This de-emphasizes exploration a bit. If you get in over your head by exploring, you have to return to the location you got in over your head, meaning you likely have to keep beating your head against a brick wall, or backtrack once you’ve hopefully retrieved your hit point. The biggest annoyance to me is that it leads to a “poor get poorer” situation where you were overmatched and died, and then when you are forced to return you’re in even more danger than you were the first time you failed. There is a way to spend the upgrade currency to retrieve your hitpoint without going back, but the game is stingy with that currency, so if you choose that option you’ve set yourself back ten or twenty minutes of grinding to the next upgrade.

There’s a potentially neat system of slotting upgrades and modifiers into a pool of upgrade points that reminds me most of [[Nier - Automata]], mostly because it’s presented similarly and because of the removable upgrades is your UI. But unless there are extraordinarily-creative upgrades further in, this system won’t be able to salvage the unpleasant core gameplay.

One other note of personal irritation. The script will every once in a while break the fourth wall to make social commentary. Get that stuff out of my games. Either have something to say, or say nothing, but by no means include a cynical nod at the current zeitgeist without context. It’s not clever. It is provocative, but probably not in the way the designer intended.
