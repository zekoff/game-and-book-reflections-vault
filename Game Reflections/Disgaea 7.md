Truly a return to form for a singular and strange divergent evolutionary path of the SRPG genre. On the Switch, the performance is surprisingly good.

The most amazing thing about the game is how well it holds up as a tactical situation generator despite its power-gaming personality. Your units may be twice the level of your opponents, but if you fail to honor the way everyone’s special traits affect the battlefield or individual match-ups, you can still easily lose.

It has a perverted approach to many of the character designs and animations, which is frustrating. If you’ve been desensitized to the bizarre sexualization over years of seeing games in this style, it can be somewhere between white-noise and eye-roll. But I can imagine putting this game in front of someone who’s never seen anything like it and them being unable to overcome the art direction.

I wonder if the [[Siralim series]] series sprang from this evolutionary branch, and yet, this one holds together more as a game (versus Siralim, which truly exists only to provide a powergaming canvas upon which you may paint your masterpiece of systemic understanding).
