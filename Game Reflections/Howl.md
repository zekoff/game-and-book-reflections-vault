I thought often about what defines a puzzle game while playing Howl. I’m not sure what language to use exactly -- hard puzzle versus soft puzzle? Puzzle versus tactics? Some factors that play into this:

- Are there multiple win states?
    
- Are there multiple approaches to a single win state?
    
- Are there different levels of success for a given win state?
    

Win state itself could be a solution, or a victory screen, or simply the end of a challenge.

I generally do not like games on the far puzzle side of the spectrum. Games that may require cleverness to solve, but that may have only one solution and the puzzle is in reproducing the steps that lead to the solution.

Howl surprised me with how much I enjoyed it. It’s puzzle-tactics or a tactical puzzle. It has a very board-gamey sense, where enemies have either one or three (or later, six) hit points. One of the board-game elements of this means, with the skills, there is a major jump between a skill level that does two damage, and a skill that does three damage. Both kill a one-HP monster, but only of them outright kills a three-HP monster.

Skills are also situationally useful.

I appreciated the “Confidence” mechanic actually after I had already concluded the story of the game. Because I realized that, if I were playing totally safe, I could take exactly one Turn per Round, and know what the enemies would do, and just complete the level with a low confidence score. (Although I wouldn’t have access to the skills which can only be used on certain high turns of a round.)

Surprisingly readable and user-friendly interface and presentation. Some rough edges as you learn what the difference is between a Round and a Turn and an Action. Then also understanding what the small number of different enemy types will do and where they will move each Turn.

This is the first game I’ve 100% completed in a LONG time. I actually ran out of game long before I had exhausted the fun. I went back to previous levels to rescue each survivor, and kill every monster, and gain every confidence point. One particular oddity I found is that in a single level, to gain maximum confidence, I actually had to KILL the final survivor in order to stop the round counter and thus gain maximum confidence. This was a little jarring and might not have been intended. But, it’s possible I simply couldn’t see a different solution. (Unlikely as I was very conversant in the game’s systems by that point, but possible). It struck me as in opposition to the game’s theme -- it’s always good to rescue survivors, right? But the other admittedly generous way of reading the thematic fit of this level is that, by killing the survivor, the Prophet was preventing them from the horror of become a monster. That actually does work thematically, although it’s a little bit of eisegesis (reading my meaning into the text). Still, the fact that the game was tightly constructed and thematically coherent enough to prompt this level of examination is telling.

I get the sense that this game has not been a resounding commercial success, which is a shame. It’s immaculately crafted. It has 9 reviews on Steam, which I suspect basically means dead on arrival. I haven’t found a review on any major game site that I frequent, now several days after release. It also appears to have surprise-released on a certain day, although I’ve seen at least one preview article so they were making some kind of press rounds beforehand.

And Howl is a game that, if I am generous to myself and my abilities, is the kind of game I could and would make. Here’s an example of a product I’d be proud to have worked on, was made with love and polish, is priced reasonably, and appears to have already commercially failed.

It’s $15 which I suppose is outside of market expectations for a tactics game that I beat in about 3 hours (100%’d in maybe 5), but which is excellent. And I got WAY more than $3/hour of enjoyment out of the game.
