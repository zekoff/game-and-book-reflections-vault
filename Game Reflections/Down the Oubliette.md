Puzzle-y tower defense game. Simple but thoughtful in the first levels. The use of the character is clever, It’s your player agent, moving around in the world. It’s what places towers, so it’s your cursor in that sense. It also is the thing the ghosts pursue when they spawn. This also solves a design problem of allowing trap loops for the ghosts. Your character must be able to flee, so if you build a trap room for the ghosts… you’re trapped in there with them too. There is a light minesweeper element where you can tell if you 2 or 1 spaces away from a ghost spawn location. It was billed as playable with one hand, which it really isn’t.
