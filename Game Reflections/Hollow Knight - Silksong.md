Probably five hours in with a growing suite of abilities. I'm stuck at where my brother described his two-hour mark. I see what they're doing, I like the tweaks, it's a more perfect [[Hollow Knight]]. It hasn't risen past that for me.

I had forgotten one of the defining features of HK is that you knock back yourself when you strike an enemy. Neither a good nor bad thing just a particular characteristic that affects how you play a lot. I will never get tired of bopping enemy heads to get bonus jumps.

It's pretty hard but not over the line for me. I really like all of the bosses so far. Pattern recognition is even more important that reflexes. My most fun mental shift fighting them has been: it's not about DPS. It's about not making mistakes. Don't try to eke out that extra strike. Just back off and continue reading them.

I had a negative reaction when I got the wall jump. I kept holding out for key abilities that were more unique. That's my single biggest thing in Metroidvanias. Give me key abilities, hopefully traversal abilities, that I haven't seen before. The wall jump disappointed me. It's a move I've had in my mental lexicon since stage 0 of [[Megaman X]].

If there's something I'm really looking forward to it's more crests. The beast crest isn't for me but the theory is VERY much for me.

As with all Switch games, I will continue to play almost exclusively in handheld mode. That’s puts an upper limit on the amount I will play it due to the twitch reactions required on the JoyCons.
