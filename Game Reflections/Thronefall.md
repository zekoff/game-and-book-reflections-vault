Several things separate this from the tower defense games I’ve played in the past. First, each stage is defined by a power arc of growing capability. Second, strategic economy management. Third, balance between short-term decision making and long-term planning. Fourth, the trappings of building a kingdom as opposed to defense for the sake of defense. Non-tower defenses add texture and utility. Perks allow build-crafting far beyond defense upgrade paths. The controllable hero character is balanced so that its presence matters but its absence can be worked around. It’s possible or even likely that any one of these features has been done before, but the combination creates a compelling experience.

The art direction is unique but could be swapped in for a number of different things.

The promise of a reward at the end of the night, and the promise of funneling in into a variety of upgrades, creates a one-more-term loop. Along with the kingdom-building themes, there is a little touch of [[Civilization series]] here.

Campaign versus endless mode.

Tickles one of my particular itches which is the ability to engine build early on so that I can overwhelm the power curve in the later waves. There’s even a particular perk that gives additional start gold at the cost of slightly reduced overall gold from enemies. The starting increase allows a kickstart to the economy building though and can easily overcome the overall lost gold. The game has also forced me to learn the line between when I’ve over-extended on economy at the expense of surviving early waves.

I listened today to an interview of Eugene Jarvis. Jarvis designed [[Defender]] and [[Robotron]]. He mentioned that classic arcade games were often in the mold of Space Invaders, where enemies attack in waves of increasing difficulty. What an incredibly pervasive basic framework. Thronefall actually stands in that legacy. (As does [[Satryn DX]] with its direct Robotron links, [[Galaga]], [[Nuclear Throne]], [[Shogun Showdown]], and many others.) The power of this framework is that it provides a natural ramp of increasing difficulty, punctuated by the downtime in the breaks between wave. This matches the concept of the engagement curve well, where the graph of intensity against time should look like a sawtooth function that generally trends upwards. The key downside of this framework is that, while it helps develop player skill, there is only a small sweet spot in the curve where a player is competing at their actual level of skill. Everything before that is too easy, and shortly thereafter it becomes too difficult. Another downside is that it ends with a loss -- generally a bad feeling. Sid Meier would say that the computer’s job is to put up a fight and then lose. The computer will never lose in this system.

Thronefall handles these two key weakness in standard ways but ways that adequately solve the problem. It avoids the boredom of the initial phase through its strategic economy. If you can toe the line of defensive capability versus economic capability, you will be in a better position later since you invested early winnings at the cost of a difficult early game. In extreme cases, you can actually invert the difficulty trendline such that the final levels are the easiest as enemies break themselves against iron defenses. The second weakness of this framework is handled in two ways. First, stages have only a set number of waves. If you outlast them, you win. An end in something better than a loss. Second, if you do lose, you will have gained the metaprogression resource (experience points) which unlocks new content for future runs in the form of weapons and perks.

That last item is likely the key to why many run-based games become much less fun after everything attainable has been unlocked with the metaprogression resource. Losing is fine when it gives you resources you can pump back into a better next run. When that drip-feed slows down, though, you’re left with nothing but the loss.

“Losing is fun,” the mantra of [[Dwarf Fortress]], may be fine in a game that positions itself as a story generator. It’s generally not fun in every other type of game.

When maxed out you get a trophy for each few and far between level ups. Coincidentally I haven't played since I maxed out.

This is to kingdom new lands what darkest dungeon is to [[XCOM]]. Taking an established tactical system and either compressing it to one dimension or expanding it to two dimensions.
