Played through the demo level three times to keep improving. “The friction is the game” in this case. In both senses of the word “friction.” Friction from a physics standpoint in moving the ball of garbage, and friction in that the physics fight back a little bit and the game is about working through and around the physics.

The core of collecting junk is fine. The absurd aesthetic is almost charming. I might have connected more with it earlier in my life. When a game is built around a single mechanic you must be able to connect intimately with that mechanic. I wasn’t able to connect with the rolling.

Minor note but the alarm pealing for the last twenty seconds of the level is intolerable. Even had I connected with the rolling mechanic more there’s a chance I would still have passed on this game based solely on the dread of hearing twenty seconds of that alarm at the end of every level.
