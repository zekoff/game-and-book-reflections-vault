Complete reimagining of the franchise. I've heard it described as the closest to the original Legend of Zelda in that it simply turns you loose. Also in that it brings back the science-fantasy aspects. The urban legend is that in Zelda 1, the pieces of the Triforce were originally supposed to be components of the reactor to a spaceship.
