Great intro movie. Beautiful and unusual art and animation. Fully voiced! Throws you directly into a battle when you hit New Game. Solid battle theme. This game makes an excellent first impression. Stylish menus with direct selection of options via button press, not unlike [[Persona]]. Timing based button press bonuses on attack and defend like [[Super Mario RPG]].

OOF. Load times of 10-15 seconds between each battle. Never has a game stumbled so hard after such a great start.

Incredibly beautiful game that is shattered by load times. It's unplayable. One to two minutes of gameplay at a time followed by a lengthy load. I'm sure it's because of the Switch that the load times are so bad, but I can't stomach this. 

I recall from the demo a while back that there's some kind of time shifting gimmick. I'll never make it to see that.
