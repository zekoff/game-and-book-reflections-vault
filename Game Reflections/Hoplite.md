Picking this game back up after literally years of having it installed on my phone -- this particular app installation has probably been transferred between multiple phones at this point. One of my favorite true roguelikes of all time. Since last played heavily, a major improvement has been added in the form of slight icon tweaks to the suite of abilities that show what prayers are affecting each power. The prayer increasing spear throw distance adds an up arrow to the spear, the one adding a single-hit bubble shield to the bash move now shows a circle icon near the shield; etc. This requires a little practice to get used to all the icons, but makes the game infinitely more suitable to picking up again after time away. Your abilities are all there onscreen instead of buried a couple of clicks into a menu. More than ever, this gives the game one of the trademarks of true roguelikes, where you need to recognize a critical situation and step away to gather your thoughts. When you return, you see your abilities again even if you might have forgotten in the meantime.

I’m pursuing the final achievement I haven’t unlocked yet: descend to depth 27 three times in a row without using the same major power in any of the three runs. This is forcing me to experiment with new builds.
