This is dire. The aesthetic appeal snookered me. I love the way [[Crystal Project]] mixed 3D voxel terrain with 2D character sprites. Similar here. The camera has a fairly low position that splits the difference almost exactly between overhead and side view. There is a focal point effect where things far from the camera are out of focus. It looks nice. 

The UI contains images that are stretched to incorrect height/width ratios. Other elements are partially cut off by the edges of the screen. No cohesion. Some images are pixel-y, then there are 9-patch background containers, then sheek bars for “HP” and “⚡”. 

Basic toolbar at the bottom. Every time you pass the hoe tool as you switch tools, a menu appears to select seeds. 

Unclear which tile you will affect when you perform an action. Holding the action to repeat along with a direction causes your character to inch that direction leaving you on the same time. Versus stepping one tile at a time for repeat actions. 

There is some kind of monster thing following me. It was green at first and now has a black rainbow texture of some kind? Now orange. 

My first plant is called “campanula.”

The music is the same eight measures over and over. No real melody. A repeated clapping noise on the beat. Repetitive to the point of being grating. 

While writing this the screen flickered and said “fainted” and now it's a new day. Different music. Still repetitive but now a piano. 

There is dialogue and some tutorial text. It often lacks basic structural elements like punctuation marks. It barely communicates the intent of each line of dialogue. 

This may be the most unfinished game I've ever played relative to its $15 price. Horrifying.
