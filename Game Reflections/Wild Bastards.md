Quite difficult. I read in a review that it doesn’t show its hand until a few hours in. That’s certainly true. It’s a complicated game. Not just complex, but also complicated. It introduces only some of its mechanics with tutorials. I think ultimately this is the right approach. Otherwise, the first two hours would be punctuated by tutorial messages every three minutes. Many of the planet locations have only their short descriptor to tell you what they do. It took me a while to get the terminology straight in my mind. What’s warping versus what’s beaming up, what’s a Charged Ace versus a regular Ace, what the dozens of different planet and location modifiers signify.

The moment-to-moment shooting is most reminiscent of [[System Shock 2]], even more so than [[Void Bastards]]. Movement is generally deliberate, aiming is a little fiddly, and slow tactical approaches are always, always, always superior to running in guns blazing. In fact, I’m surprised how much the game encourages stealth and the use of audio cues. There is a computer chirping noise at some points that is exactly the same as one of the terminals in System Shock 2.

I usually love games where attrition is a factor, as it is here. I also like games where you can’t wisely take on every single enemy. The loss of most gear between warps is a useful constraint. It dissuades you from hoarding things and thus prevents my incurable fear of using consumable items.

The game continues to grow on me after several more hours in. It was designed to funnel you towards a specific experience. First you plan ahead based on your resources and the tradeoffs between options ahead of you. You commit to a location and then get dealt a hand via the planet layout including whether one of your characters is scattered. Then you approach each showdown and make the best of it. This includes knowing when to hold ‘em and when to fold ‘em -- whether to keep pressing on with the planet and get more loot, and when to bail. The feud and pal system along with the enemy compositions is designed to prevent you from riding one preferred pairing of characters into the sunset.

The loop of the game is a little unusual. It has a strategic layer (warping around with the Drifter), a tactical layer (moving across the planet), and the innermost action loop of the showdown. One thing that’s really grown on me is how playing those two layers well really sets you up for success in any showdown. You can tip the odds strongly in your favor. Learning the various enemy and location types also helps because it prods you to bring certain characters and to approach the showdown in a suitable way.

Completed the narrative campaign after 20-ish hours. The game achieved what it set out to do. I used, and consistently enjoyed, every character and dozens of pairings during shootouts. I sent bands out based on the encounters they’d face. I chose perks from Aces in ways that lightly broke the game, but I could never rely fully on a broken character because they might not be available. I approached the planet maps thoughtfully and learned when discretion was the better part of valor. The same was true on the strategic layer. And, I laughed more times than I expected at the witticisms, banter, and silliness of the writing.

Perhaps an odd thing to have an opinion on, but: I appreciate that when guards at a roadblock are reduced by half, any rounding is in favor of the player. It's an attitude of generosity in design. A tiny thing that makes you feel appreciative instead of slighted.
