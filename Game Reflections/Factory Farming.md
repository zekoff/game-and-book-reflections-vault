Of the three games I purchased outside of the Playdate’s “Season One” games, this one feels like the least well fitted for the console. It’s a farming automation game that feels both unpolished and slightly too ambitious for the form factor. The graphics are ugly, nearly to the point of being unreadable. The crank is used only for a zoom feature with a measly two levels. To me, this is a game that asked a reasonable question: “what would [[Factorio]] look like on the Playdate?” The problem is that the answer drew the wrong lessons. Instead of building around the tiny, crisp screen, the surprisingly powerful speaker, the singular crank input, and the generally offbeat nature of the console, it focused on fighting the constraints of the small screen and the limited input options. The design cuts against the grain of the wood, instead of with it.
