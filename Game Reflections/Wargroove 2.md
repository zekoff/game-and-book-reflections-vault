It’s definitely [[Advance Wars]]. One of the defining features of this style is that you move and act as the same turn for that unit, meaning there’s a real opportunity cost for filling a tile if you need that tile for some adjacency bonus. Highlights the very different approach of [[Disgaea series|Disgaea]], where not only is move disconnected from act, but you can move two units that benefit from adjacency, commit an action for only one of them, then freely back out the movement of the second unit after the first has benefitted from whatever adjacency bonus you needed. The Advance Wars / Wargroove approach makes adjacency much more flexible, but also much more limited as a “resource”. I think I personally prefer the Disgaea approach, but the Disgaea approach is also less sensible, more game-like, and more fiddly.

The middle ground is something like [[XCOM]], where you get a move and an action, and can’t back out of either once committed, but you can move multiple characters and set up their actions, thus partially committing to each turn in stages.
