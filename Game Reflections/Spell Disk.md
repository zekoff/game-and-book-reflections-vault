Nice action roguelike. The headline feature is that powers can be mixed-and-matched as you unlock or purchase them. It allows a higher degree of freedom over crafting game-breaking builds. Very fun and flexible. Strikes me as an unhinged version of the power mixing in Supergiant’s [[Transistor]].

I would have stopped playing eventually because the game is a little button-mashy. But something else stopped me early. While trying to remap controls, I achieved a state where every single button in the game (including menu traversal) was mapped to down on the L stick. The only way to fix it was to delete my entire save file and start over. Unbelievable. I uninstalled immediately after.
