After the tutorial mission, seems like it will be an enjoyable experience. The difficulty even in the opening mission is tuned such that you can’t simply ignore the mechanics of the game. In the boss fight against the helicopter, you’ve got to stay mobile and keep up the pressure. You can’t outlast the onslaught completely, but you also can’t soak it in a rush to take down the boss. You have to dodge, use all of your weapons, employ your mobility tricks to control range, and even use the terrain to your advantage (blocking missile barrages with buildings).

I took particular note of the following tutorial message when the shop was introduced: something along the lines of “you can sell parts back to the shop for the same price you bought them.” This was my cue to experiment with builds. If I knew I’d only be able to sell parts back for less than what I bought them, it would have dramatically reduced my willingness to experiment. That said, there was still a hump I had to get over to actually begin experimenting. I had to get far enough into the campaign flow to have enough cash that I could kit out a separate AC (not just an improved version of the starter AC). At that time, I had to suffer through about an hour in the training arena plus a few missions where I was simply not feeling like I had a good handle on the game anymore. I hadn’t tweaked a really solid build because I didn’t have a good feel for the various parts, plus I simply wasn’t as skilled with the new setup as I was with the old one. I did finally get over this hump and learned more about the system as well as which weapons I like and don’t so far, and I sense there’s more I could still learn. There is a quite a bit more mechanical depth to unpack in this game.

The bosses are real highlights, and they do not go down without a fight. For all of the bosses except for the first one (the gigantic desert strider), I’ve been stuck on them for multiple attempts. Sometimes what feels like dozens of attempts. For some bosses I’ve actually needed to change my assembly/build at the game over screen, which I generally do not like in games. I don’t like non-diegetic game over screens, and I don’t like the idea that I could get to a checkpoint in a mission with one build, die, and change build for the next section. There’s no in-game way this makes sense. However, there’s also no way to tell from a mission’s briefing what challenges you might actually face during the mission, so there’s no true way to prepare diegetically beforehand. I just accept that this is a different structure. You can always go back and replay missions to try for higher ranks. All that to say, the choice of build can take a boss from realistically unbeatable to simply very difficult. Never trivial so far, but achievable with repetition. I also think I’m ultimately coming down on the side of appreciating how none of the bosses so far are just damage sponges. They have patterns to learn, attacks to avoid, weak points to target, phases to endure.

There’s no pilot upgrade system, which actually works for me the more I think about it. *I’m* the pilot, so the upgrades are in my skills, regardless of how I kit out my mech.

The training missions turned out to be very important for introducing me to the different part archetypes, especially the dramatically different Leg types.

As I’ve progressed in the campaign, I have definitely unlocked parts that are better than others -- same broad type but generally improved stats. The new parts of the same types don’t strictly obsolete old parts though, as the old parts are generally lighter weight so could be useful, plus of the similar-type parts I’ve unlocked I don’t think I’ve hit any that function identically. For example, I got into a groove with a pair of machine pistols, and when I unlocked the next tier of similar items, the new ones were burst-fire instead of full-auto. They definitely filled the same niche as my old ones, but feel a little different in use.

“I’ve got a job for you, 621.”

I have really liked the arena matches that unlock each time you reach a new chapter. These are nail-biting duels that feel fair and yet truly test your abilities. I feel like this is the mode where you can succeed with any build you’re good with, so feels like a more fair representation of my skill (versus missions where perhaps I just walked in with the wrong build).

I could see a future where I go back with lots of parts to choose from and try to optimize my rank in previous missions. There might be a good bit of game there.

The structure of linear campaign with discrete missions is very 90’s or 00’s, and yet it works. It’s neat that this game is right on the heels of [[Elden Ring]]. Still some recognizably FromSoft elements like limited repair kit consumables, unique bosses, a story that’s self-serious and somewhat incomprehensible, punishingly intricate stats to understand, and some real difficulty that’s off-putting at times and can’t simply be out-leveled.

This is a very impressive and confident game, and it nails what it’s trying to be -- the king of mech action games. Nothing else I’ve played in a decade comes to close to what exactly this game is trying to be. I think about the demo I played of that Switch mecha game. [[Daemon X Machina]]? How underwhelming I recall it being, compared to how polished this game is.

And it’s notable how differently the various builds can play. Lots of room for self-expression, playing to your own strengths, and yet still the need to pick builds that work and fit the mission.

Thinking about this game led me to wonder what I would review it. It’s not an 8/10. It’s not a 9/10. It’s a 7/10 if you want a cohesive AAA experience with a compelling story and high production value across the board. It’s a 10/10 if you want a mech action game. I would definitely recommend that someone play it, regardless, because it does things worth noticing. On the other hand, [[Tears of the Kingdom|The Legend of Zelda - Tears of the Kingdom]] is definitely a 10/10 on any scale, and yet it’s ultimately missable if you’ve played [[Breath of the Wild|The Legend of Zelda - Breath of the Wild]].
