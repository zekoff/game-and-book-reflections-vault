Compulsive to the point that I have become mildly physically ill a couple of times after being unable to stop myself from playing late at night. There is never a good stopping point. The path to completion of every task takes you past two more incomplete tasks with desirable rewards. There are many buckets to fill, to use Sid Meier’s phrase. The game is also bursting with systems and destinations. There are probably three completely full games packed into this: the open world, the [[Animal Crossing]]-like village building, and the Life system (each of which is full-featured enough to be its own full RPG class), and the random dungeons.

One of the brilliances of the game is that so much feeds into the crafting system and that there is just a bit of overlap between multiple Lives in each set of crafting types. Blacksmithing requires just a bit of Carpentry which requires just a bit of Woodcutting.

Combat is less optional than I’d expect. Combat still ties everything together and there are many non-optional fights on the story’s critical path. There’s also no combat options besides direct damage dealing. With a robust companion system in place, I’d have expected at least one combat life focused on being a support role.

I made it to 4th-tier content of 5 total and stopped in the final chapter. The story did not develop into anything meaningful to me. Mechanically it remained sound and repetitive, which in this case is part of the charm. Easy to accomplish something and feel progress without too much effort. The combat finally got tiresome and I think is what drove me away at the end. Enemy health scaled faster than equipment power even with my mildly-broken Blacksmithing approach. I ended up mashing the same small number of abilities over and over with no gain in skill and no new tricks to learn or any capacity for expressive fighting style. If the game had allowed me to opt out of combat I would have finished it. I still think it's odd that the game requires you to engage with combat despite it describing itself as “slow life”. Nonetheless, I like that combat is in the game. It's just boring combat.
