Clear artistic direction. Clean lines, untextured polygons, a 2D look that seamlessly transitions into 3D movement, and simple but driving music. The gameplay is unusual while still being familiar as a classic brick-breaking game. There is a frame story about a digital extinction-level event that the player character is trying to understand. Additional story is doled out after accomplishing a number of stage milestones, which naturally ties story progression to gameplay success.
