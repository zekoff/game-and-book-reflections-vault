A true old-school first-person dungeon crawler in the vein of [[Wizardry]]. This is more what I expected when I first saw [[Demon Quest 85]]. It’s a systemic game with endless levels and procedural generation. It is far superior to [[Under the Tree]], the other old-school dungeon crawler I’ve tried on Playdate. That game had hand-placed encounters, authored maps, and incredibly stingy rewards. This one leans fully into randomness. From what I can tell so far, there are item types that favor certain stat distributions in their randomness, a method to what monsters appear on each floor, and a set of well-defined stats that factor into playstyles and combat options. Everything else leans hard into procedural generation. The graphics are more than adequate for this type of game. The UI also remains static across everything. Monsters, treasure, and exploration all occurs in the same window with the rest of the UI information surrounding it. This goes a long way towards whatever passes for “immersion” on the Playdate. (The Playdate has many cool things going for it, but immersive experiences are not on the list.)

I believe this game will get stale fairly soon, unfortunately. Other than stat scaling, I don't see much variation on the basic mechanics. No real chance for any kind of emergent behavior that I can see.

…Switched to another game on the console and when I came back to this one found that there is no save function. You leave, your character is gone.

Tried again weeks later and it's simply explicable that a crunchy RPG in 2024 has no persistence at all. The sleep function of the Playdate is at the device level so doesn't count. I suppose it unintentionally reflects the teleological, ephemeral truth of all games: the game only truly exists in my mind, and the only thing that lasts is what I take with me in thought and memory.
