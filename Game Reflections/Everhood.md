I don't remember the last game I hated this much. Dreaded music encounters. Difficult and with no rhyme or reason to the note pattern. I heard the analog stick clack over and over. Fever dream aesthetics. Literally encourages the player to leave text on the slowest scroll speed. The game feels smug but doesn't deliver. The music is supposedly the headlining feature. However, it’s a very mixed bag. The best songs are passable dance music. The worst songs are just thumping cacophonies with no discernable musicality (at least to my potentially untrained ears, as perhaps it is using a musical language I am simply not familiar with, in the way that jazz can be cacophony to the untrained ear).

My reaction is at odds with the overwhelming critical consensus.
