Played 15 minutes of the demo version. I prefer the [[Megaman X]] series with wall jumping and dashing but I do like the Rush Coil and slide approach of MM. The signature change in this game appears to be the Double Gear system. Slow down time or amp up power. I like this too. I'd have to train myself to lean more on it. The difficulty is pretty high but I suppose that's typical. The biggest hit really stopping me from purchasing is the knowledge that it will require precision platforming and button mashing. Not worth that.
