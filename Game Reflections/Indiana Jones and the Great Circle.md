It was wonderful to play through the opening of Raiders as a flashback and tutorial all at the same time. Coming off of [[Final Fantasy VII Rebirth]] it was shocking how poorly animated and wax-doll that the characters were. I got spoiled for 80 hours with that perfection and didn’t realize how good it was.
