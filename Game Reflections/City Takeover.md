Of the genre where you have a bunch of nodes with numbers on them and you draw paths to transfer the numbers. Ultimately you are smashing your numbers into the enemy numbers by drawing more paths. There is some depth there despite the reductive description. This one is a cheap mobile game ported to the Switch. It's not good, but it was worth 50 cents (which is what I paid for it).
