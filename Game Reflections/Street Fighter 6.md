The Drive Impact and Drive Parry system make the rock-paper-scissors aspect more explicit. My guess is that there are now two axes of yomi: attack/defend/throw, and attack/impact/parry. A complex web but not too complex. Not so many inputs that a match would just become random noise.

The aesthetic emphasis is on the street in Street Fighter. Animations and character design are all informed by the colorful scrawl of graffiti art. Street Fighter 2 was informed by eastern traditions despite the worldwide setting. This is informed by western traditions.
