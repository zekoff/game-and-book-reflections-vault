The ability to switch seamlessly between overhead and first-person views is the game’s greatest magic trick. There are minor benefits to one or the other occasionally. First-person is actually a little better in crowded melee combat, and overhead makes navigation easier when exploring a new area. That doesn’t matter though. It’s fun to just have both of them at the press of a button. This is my favorite feature of the game.

Melee combat is not very dynamic. The number of pets onscreen makes it exceptionally difficult to see what’s happening, but there’s also a major lost upside by benching them, so I tend to keep them deployed nonetheless. Being able to re-spec attribute and ability points for no cost is freeing.

There are two minigames that are really closer to full-on embedded games -- a Spire-like and a Survivors-like. They’re actually a little too meaty for me but I’m fascinated that they’re in there. The most relaxing part of the game is crafting. Each type of crafting has a single one-button timing minigame to increase chances of success. The crafting skills are fairly grindy and there are usually ample resources for them, so it’s just a matter of turning your brain off for a while and grinding.

Movement is very slow. There are indications that a mount will be available later. The game is poorly documented. A brief tutorial is available at the start of the game but there seems to occasionally be buried functionality, like holding “Y” to pick up pets and transfer them to storage.
