Profoundly stupid name. Excellent game. Has elements of [[Minesweeper]], [[Defense of the Oasis]], and even classical roguelikes.

I appreciate that you can tell the whole game state by looking at the current layout. There is no transient information, with one small exception. This helps tremendously with setting the game aside and coming back later. It's a particularly good trait for a Switch game. The one minor exception I've encountered to this rule so far is with the character Shadow. If you reveal an enemy and then it becomes hidden again as a result of your abilities, there will be a temporary marker on the tile where the enemy was revealed and is now hidden. For some reason though, the marker is removed after a certain number of turns.

Structurally close to a true roguelike. The meta progression only grants expanded options, not direct power increases. Some of the expanded options might be more powerful, but in general I consider them more situational. I am always a little skeptical of games where the expanding options dilute the other options, but this game is pretty resistant to overanalysis. 

I love the very different play styles offered by the six different characters. Especially the three different base archetypes force dramatically different ways of interacting with the same underlying system. 

Played up to NG+3 with every class, and unlocked all unlockables.
