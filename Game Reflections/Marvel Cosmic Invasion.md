Not nearly as tight as I was expecting. [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - Shredder’s Revenge]] had crisp pixel art, expressive animations, intuitive hitboxes, and consistent movesets across characters. That last one should and is different with this game. Coming to grips with it will come with time. Otherwise I’m surprised at how poorly this game implements the other elements. The combat itself is most lacking. It feels limp compared to SR. It might be that enemies are a little tankier or that their on-hit animations aren’t as satisfying. This game is also quite difficult -- I don’t remember struggling on any of the early levels in SR. Here I’ve completely wiped and had to restart a level at least twice.

Upon reflection, lack of consistency between characters might be exactly what I’m struggling with. I don’t always know which characters will do what and what hidden tweaks they implement. I change characters every level based on whatever the campaign highlights as the relevant story characters. As a result, I rarely remember critical things like whether my character is a dodge character or a block character. That will actually become more enjoyable when I settle down and pick a couple. This is really the phase of an early Super Smash Brothers binge. I sample everything to get my feet under me before I settle in.

The story in the campaign is simultaneously opaque and irrelevant. Disconcerting.

Encounter design and enemy composition lean on the same types repeated throughout the levels. There are a few reskins that behave differently. It’s an acceptable level of variety but not special. Level design is bland. Enemies and environmental hazards can stunlock you for half of your health bar at times. Very frustrating. The variety in characters is actually frustrating when it’s boiled down. Because each can have a different set of moves, enemies have to be able to respond to lots of things. In general, they can’t. So the difficulty then comes from throwing too many enemies on the screen at once.

The Y direction of the belt is not signaled well. It’s difficult to know what “lane” enemies are in. This leads to surprise whiffs when you try to attack, and surprise hits when enemies you thought were out of range make contact with you. Flying enemies exacerbate this problem. They don’t have shadows (baffling) so it’s even more difficult to tell where they are.

Special moves are limp. Activating a special in a group of enemies rarely wipes them out.

The UI is workmanlike. Each character has exactly the same UI. Regardless of their special power, they just have a counter showing how many times that special power can be used. Characters don’t even have end-of-stage flourishes.

Voice lines are great and the actors do a nice job with one-liners.
