Brings the [[Final Fantasy VII Rebirth|FFVII]] bombing run right out of the gate. Where Midgar is more industrial fantasy, this is more science fantasy. The diorama backgrounds are as beautiful as promised. I don't care for the look of the characters though. They scream mobile game but my eye isn't sophisticated enough to say why.
 
I'm taking pause because of the reviews I've read. The combat near the end becomes something like a puzzle, but one that you have to solve before the boss. With skill selections, equipment choices, and party makeup. I deeply dislike this in any game. I like adjusting on the fly and making the most of the hand I'm dealt. Optimizing around something that I couldn't have known diegetically is completely immersion breaking. This goes to my personal axiom of “never let me see a game over screen.” The Souls games are a great example of how to handle this. You're going to see a failure screen many many times. But it makes sense in the world of the game. The Shock games do something similar. [[System Shock 2]] with its cell backup facilities and a [[BioShock Infinite]] with its stepping back in from an alternate dimension or taking a hand from Elizabeth.
