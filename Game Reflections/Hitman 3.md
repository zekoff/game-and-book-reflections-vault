I ought to like this game for the same reasons I like immersive sims, but the bottom line is that I can’t get over the theme. You’re assassinating bad people, but… like my reaction to [[Dishonored - Death of the Outsider|Dishonored: Death of the Outsider]], I simply don’t have the willingness to watch detailed virtual murder of lifelike people as the central (only…) objective of the game.
