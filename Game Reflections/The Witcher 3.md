The steel and silver swords that were so prounounced in [[The Witcher]] are much reduced here. The automatic switching between them makes them much less meaningful.

I remember playing for a while after borrowing my brother's Playstation for a while. I enjoyed it then but didn't play it to completion.

Came back to it when a Switch version released. I remember being set free into the open world and recoiling at the number of gathering points that littered the map. I couldn't get past it. I regret that I've missed one of the great games of our generation.
