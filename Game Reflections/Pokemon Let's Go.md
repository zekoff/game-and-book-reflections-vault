Played only the demo although I play to buy the Eevee version. I’m surprised how much I remember from the original Pokemon (I can’t remember if I had Red or Blue). I definitely appreciate that catching has been divorced from random encounters. It makes catching its own pastime to pursue. The game is still burdened by the single most frustrating thing for me about Pokemon: the glacial pace of battles.

Purchased to play with Jack. It's been great fun to see how different our Pokedexes are after just a few hours of gameplay. Trading has been the highlight.
