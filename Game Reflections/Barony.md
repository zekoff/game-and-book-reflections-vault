Confident in what it is. Tutorials are thorough, unforgiving, and effective. The reliance on reflexes is not to my taste but that doesn’t mean it’s not done well. The hotbar is particularly effective. Three face buttons are mapped to the hotbar. Each of the three can be set with an item for single-press. Each can also be used as a chord with shoulder buttons to triple the number of slots. The end result is a fairly standard number of hotbar slots but they can all be quickly accessed.

There are nods to [[Nethack]] and the game is generally steeped in nerdery. For instance, there are an inexplicably-high number of fountains in the dungeon. Cursed items are common, spells come from spellbooks. There are six core stats that mirror D&D (other than INT -> Perception). There are also many classes which seem highly differentiated. A preponderance of skills as well, each of which has a game-breaking mastery level. On paper, the systems alone mean this game should be catnip for me.

The game signals it’s made for co-op. I ploughed ahead in single player nonetheless. I became frustrated because the difficulty is often unfair and quite random. However, I can see it being very fun in co-op. Two classes with offsetting strengths would be more than doubly as effective as a single hero.
