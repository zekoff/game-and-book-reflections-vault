The sort of game that’s catnip for me as a designer. One-screen dungeon crawler that is played with only two buttons -- right and down. Putting it in “info mode” requires pressing A then allows four-directional movement, but technically the game could be played via iconography alone if you were experienced enough, so I’ll still count two buttons. A variety of classes and abilities. Seems to be quite difficult. The initial objective is to make it to dungeon level 50 but I’ve only made it to around 20. I could see getting better already by planning further ahead instead of playing only one move ahead. It’s likely more strategic than I’m giving it credit for. Like the great [[Jupiter Hell]] in that you could get good enough to quickly read any situation and input the right button presses immediately as needed to complete a screen.
