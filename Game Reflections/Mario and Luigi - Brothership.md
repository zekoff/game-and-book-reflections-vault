Unbelievably cute animations and expressiveness from the brothers. Ponderously wordy for a game where the main characters are Groot-like in their dialogue. “Mario” and “Luigi” make up the whole of the brothers’ script. One minute of gameplay will be followed by two minutes of dialogue. Combat loading screens are just barely scraping by into permissible. When in combat, however, the timing-based attacks are smooth.

A number of hours further in and the game is loosening up a bit. The first major dungeon contained some enemies that threatened me for the first time -- I found myself sheepishly using Mushrooms after battles. Me! Using consumables! And yet I got better the more I fought them in that dungeon. Not “got stronger.” Got better. That’s an extraordinary trick for an RPG that is still broadly traditional.

Came back a few months later and had one of those experiences where my thoughts crystallized in the meantime. This game is well made and full of charm. It is just too on rails for my taste. Fairly stingy with upgrades and unlocking systems. It also relies on the painful JRPG holdover of having to occasionally find and talk to one specific NPC to advance the story. In a case like this, where I have stepped away for a few months, I no longer have any idea who or where that person is other than a general quest indicator of which island they are on.

I don't like the new characters like Connie. I do like the sense of discovery and surprise on each new island. And I do like the Super Mario RPG vibes that sneak in from time to time. Through little nods like ISIS striking a colorful pose like the Axem Rangers.
