I can’t remember what this stands for -- something adjacent to communist urban planning. This is a game that could be at home on another console, but still fits the Playdate. It’s in the tile-laying or building-placement sub-genre that includes things like [[Islanders]] and [[Dorfromantik]]. It’s run-based and centered around score attack, influenced by recent roguelikes and their common crutch of “re-rolls” to find something that fits your needs. Sadly doesn’t use the crank, but feels full-featured granted its limited scope.
