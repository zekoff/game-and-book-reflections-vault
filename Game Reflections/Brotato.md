Heard about it as the hype from [[Vampire Survivors]] trailed off. The theme is profoundly stupid, but also could be copy-pasted with any other theme so it didn’t matter as much. As I think I recall one reviewer saying, the whole graphical and UI approach of the game calls to mind Flash games in the early 2000’s. The game does require more twitch reflex than Vampire Survivors, but it also has more visible crunchiness in character classes and builds, so for my personal tastes it’s respectively worse in one area but better in another than VS. It does do an excellent job getting me into a flow state where I am reading the whole screen and responding on instinct -- the twitchiness comes from the requirement to quickly change directions with the stick, more than the need to time button presses by reflex.
