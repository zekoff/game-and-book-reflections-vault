Demo version. Very anime -- big expressions, lots of yelling, superpowers. The music is attention-getting. Songs have thumping beats and unusual instrumentation. The blood aesthetic is not something I enjoy or will be able to handle for a long period of time. There’s little true gore but lots of blood spurting and dripping. The initial cast of characters all have “a thing” that matches their design and which makes them stand out. They are named with a Japanese schema that makes me inadequately equipped to recall easily. I have similar trouble with fantasy names in general at times but find it easier when they are spelled in a Western tradition.

There are three gameplay modes so far in the demo and I doubt there are more to find. There is a visual novel mode which mixes movies with dialogue. There is a very basic exploration mode where you can run left and right. And there is the battle system, which is grid-based turn-based tactics. Movement and actions are linked in that you select your action first, it defines your movement range, then you finalize the destination grid and facing. Action points are replenished every turn and shared among player combatants. So far it’s fairly standard tactical gameplay.

I looked it up online and the game takes about 160-180 hours to complete. I wasn’t seriously considering purchasing it anyway but that certainly committed me to not purchasing it.

The one thing that hooked me was the setup of the world. What is the Last Defense Academy? What secret is it hiding inside the vault? Why is there Undying Fire and why are humans cooped up in cities with artificial skies? I tried to find a plot summary online but didn’t get any useful results. Strange in and of itself.
