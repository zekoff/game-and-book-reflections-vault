I bought this game as a counterpoint to [[Marvel Cosmic Invasion]]. Absolum has been well received by critics. I wanted to see what the difference is.

Setting aside the roguelite structure, the belt-scrolling brawler game play is of the same style as MCI. Two things jump out at me. First, each combat entity has a shadow underneath their location onscreen. This alone solves 70% of the problem of not knowing who is positioned to make contact with who. Second, no flying enemies that I’ve encountered so far. Flying enemies are always frustrating in belt scrollers. I understand their inclusion in MCI. Flying heroes are important for the fantasy of certain characters. However, this created difficulty in MCI because A) it makes understanding your character’s relative position more difficult, and B) it means you probably need to have flying enemies to threaten flying characters. I’d have simply given flying characters flying animations and special moves or more robust aerial attacks in MCI. Third, control of characters feels more responsive because characters can dodge out of most animations easily.

I haven’t fully explored the rogelite elements of the game so far, but one thing I have seen has made me very appreciative: there are many branches possible in a run. [[Jupiter Hell]] has taught me the benefits of player-shaped enemy and challenge variety in roguelikes.
