The design fixes everything that didn’t theoretically work well in the first game. One of my biggest complaints in the first game, and a common complaint from critics, was rooted in the fact that the game had no fail state. Difficulty came then from punishing dungeons which were tuned to wipe well-composed and well-played parties if the dice rolled poorly. To return to that party’s composition and power, grinding was then required to rebuild levels, trinkets, skills, and perks. The run-based nature of DD2 sets the framework of the game up to be truly making the most of a bad situation, versus the risk-mitigation approach of DD1 since a party wipe was punished with many hours of rebuilding. The candle metaprogression system is also typical of these run-based games now, and propels you into another run as soon as you complete the previous one.

The stress system in general is brilliant in both games. It provides a secondary axis of character health with the dangling carrot of a power increase. Hitting 100 stress in DD1 gave the feeling of rolling the dice as you crossed your fingers and hoped a character would rise to the challenge. DD2’s system is different but also excellent. It’s more discrete, with 10 pips and less granular management. It feeds into the character relationship system instead of being a standalone system.

The character relationships are the headlining new system. Watching those relationships form produces a powerful systemic storytelling. My imagination fills in the gaps of why my Highwayman and my Grave Robber get along, but why the Plague Doctor hates the Man at Arms. It also produces a sorely-needed element of uncertainty in skill usage. When skills become cursed or blessed, it tips the scales on why I might use or avoid one, even if the enemy party composition is the same as one I’ve seen before.

The framing of each character class being thematically the same person is another change from DD1. I’m not yet settled on whether this is better, worse, or equivalent. In DD1 the characters became a total mush that were identified solely based on their class and level. We don’t lose much from that standpoint by consistent characters. There is a little thematic disconnect though on how the same character is reborn continually in each run. However, it does set up the stories for each individual character. The stories I’ve seen so far add a lot to characterization.

I’ll never be able to go back from the stagecoach to the 2D area exploration of DD1. The presentation is more exciting while still being a breather from the combat. DD1 exploration was tense and exhausting. The stagecoach is certainly guilty of being boring on its own, but the alternating style of intense turn-based tactical combat, followed by mindless real-time stagecoach segments, does wonders for the pacing of each run.

The art and sound direction continue to be impeccable. The switch to 3D models was executed with perfection. Attacks still land with dramatic keyframes, but the idle motions of all characters and enemies add still more character and interest. The narrator is still the centerpiece of the world building. I do wish that many of the same lines from the first had returned, plus the new lines added now. In DD1, one of the lines for a DOT was: “Slowly. Gently. This is how a life is taken.” In DD2, the equivalent line is: “Incremental. But, deadly all the same.” Both work and fill the niche, but there’s no reason both can’t exist, other than the risk of perception that the game is retreading too-familiar ground.

My first completed run was my third attempt. This is perfect. During the run there was at least one moment where I was sure it would be lost but I pressed on. The loss in two previous runs forced me to learn and cope with failure. And the completion of my third gave me… yes, a glimmer of hope. I see how much more there is yet to do. But I know now that I can succeed.

I am coming to a strange relationship with this game. I kind of hate it. But I keep diving back in after failed runs. The metaprogression is actually a little misleading. The greatest improvement run over run is in my growing understanding. The meta elements are absolutely critical, no mistake. But I've actually had to learn how enemies behave and which comps highlight which threats. I'm also building the strategic insight of when to prefer which paths with the stagecoach. 

It's surprisingly easy to compose a party which just doesn't work. I wish the game would provide a little more guidance on suggested comps.
