Played half an hour of the demo. Always interesting to see what IntiCreates comes up with. Art design is striking. Weirdly alternates between methodical gameplay and surprise threats. The surprises coupled with the single hit point feel unfair. The Elephant power is neat -- just about any time dilation in an action game feels fun. Interesting that the skills are random depending on which enemy kills you.
