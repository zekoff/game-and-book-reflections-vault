Demo. Feels well crafted but not as fresh as [[Shovel Knight]] which was the same developer. A lot of time has passed in which the standard for retro-styled games has only continued to increase. The mix of Yacht Club charm with the Gothic setting isn’t as powerful as Shovel Knight’s unselfconscious bizarreness.

Mina’s signature ability to me is the burrowing. That adds the much-needed additional dimension to what would otherwise be classic top-down 2D adventure combat. I see the outlines of the level-up and trinket system and potentially the outline of a weapon modification system. I hope for a more diverse set of built-in abilities (additional buttons to press) in the full game. I’d be disappointed at the simplicity without it. I didn’t feel the same sense of exploration as in Shovel Knight. That’s perhaps because exploration in a retro 2D platformer is a bonus. Exploration in a 2D Zelda-like is table stakes.
