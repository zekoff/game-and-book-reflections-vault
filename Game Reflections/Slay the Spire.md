Deck-building roguelite. The first to become a smash success although the prior art was a game called Dream Quest, and of course the tabletop game [[Dominion]].

Besides the fact that it brought deck-building to digital games in a big way, it is also the first game that I remember having the "Intent" concept. In the turn based combat, enemies show what general move they will take next turn as well as the amount of damage that will be done if the move is an attack. The intent system in itself is I guess not dissimilar to [[Into the Breach]].
