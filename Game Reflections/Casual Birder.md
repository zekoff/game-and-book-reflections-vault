Where the Playdate itself straddles the line between whimsical and annoying, it ultimately lands on the right side of the fence (whimsy). Casual Birder feels like it’s winking too hard at the camera. I’m not quite sure if I’m supposed to identify with but am not the right audience, or if I’m supposed to join in mockery with the developers at the subject matter. Either way, it’s not for me.

Despite this flop, I’m enthusiastic about seeing what else “Season 1” of Playdate has to offer.
