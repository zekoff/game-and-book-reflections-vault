Played about 10 or 12 hours so far. Perhaps 20 runs across the five characters, of which I’ve won probably just over half. The game is to [[Into the Breach]] what [[Darkest Dungeon]] is to [[XCOM]]. It has taken the thoughtful, puzzle-like tactics of ItB and collapsed it onto a single axis. It does rely less on using enemies against each other compared to ItB and more on direct damage. This is probably the result of the objective in this game -- instead of accomplishing an objective, the goal is always to kill all enemies. The signature mechanic is the ability to upgrade tiles over the course of the run. A tile can morph into something very different than the way it started or the way it worked on the last run. Tiles become something like character crafting. There are distinct characters you can select from before a run, but they are not so strongly differentiated as to define the run all by themselves. Each has a special move triggered by moving into an enemy. These moves are very useful, and can be themselves upgraded, but end up as only one arrow in a quiver.

Excellent mechanically, self-assured artistically, and does enough to set itself apart against the glut of run-based games which swamp every digital storefront.
