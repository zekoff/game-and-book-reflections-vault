One of the all-time great names for a spy thriller. Put many hours into this game years ago. I revisited it in these twilight days of Switch 1. I think my favorite part is that you only control two agents. That’s small enough that I can easily remember what skills, equipment, and abilities each one has without digging into their character sheets after I step away from the game -- important for my cadence of playing Switch games.
