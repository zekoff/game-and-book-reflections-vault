The performance on Switch is punishingly bad. Not too long into each run the game will drop to about 15% of its standard speed. Occasionally it will return to full speed and then tank again. It robs the game of its immediacy. 

The question is, if the performance were not a factor, how does this compare to [[Vampire Survivors]]? Favorably. The space shooter framework enables different gameplay. VS suffers in repeated play because it's mostly about circling slow moving hordes and hoping that power ups scale faster than enemies. GL is more tactical. Weaving around asteroids and knowing that power ups will slowly fall off the field gives more meaning to movement. VS, despite taking place on authored levels, actually just feels like an endless empty plain most of the time. All of the terrain is the enemy formation. 

One of the small brilliances of these games is how you must actually pick up experience versus passively getting it after kills. You can't just mow things down and move on. You'll have to circle back. It gives a cyclic nature to movement and a double burst of compulsion. The hit of watching an enemy pinata some gems and then the hit of vacuuming up a bunch of gems. 

Weapons in GL are neat. The lock on and beacon weapon types set it apart from VS. Builds are more dynamic but also more constrained. Fewer slots but less of a feeling that the builds are predefined based on weapon evolutions. Perhaps too little emphasis on evolutions actually, though. I've only ever seen a few evolutions despite having completed several runs and paying close attention to the synergies.

Bosses are a welcome addition. They add big milestones and also capture the shmup aesthetic. 

A default run of GL is blessedly shorter -- 15 minutes instead of 30. I suppose that's like playing VS on hyper. 

Overall, if performance were tolerable, this would probably replace VS for the popcorn niche.
