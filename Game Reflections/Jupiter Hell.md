“Chess with shotguns.” Playing on Steam Deck years ago (!!) I remember it being fairly shallow. It did not present terribly challenging tactical problems to solve. So far, having gone through one or two branches leading up to the first boss, that still seems true. There is little-to-no item gameplay. The removal of item identification and the food clock are very significant riffs on the traditional roguelike gameplay. They certainly fit the intent of the game. It feels snappy both in mental load as well as in actual control inputs.

The discrete grid movement fits poorly with the Switch controller I play on. My D-pad is squishy. Since most of the game is pressing buttons on that D-pad, it is a significant bummer to have the tactile feeling so… limp. The standard Joycon clicky buttons would be a fantastic fit. It’s worth the tradeoff to keep my fingers free of pain but it is indeed a tradeoff.

I made it to the first area boss in my first attempt. I lost but it was a close thing. I believe that it was a tactical failing rather than an itemization issue. The boss has an AoE bombardment move that presented the most interesting tactical puzzle so far. Notable though was that most salvos could not be avoided. I’ll need to prepare in the future to soak the damage and heal through it. Conserving Fury will also help. Furthermore, I have no idea yet whether I’m managing the item game and the strategic game very well. Did I have the right balance of ammo types? Did I choose the right weapons? Did I visit enough of the branches and did I clean out the floors well? Did I choose appropriate skills for my build and intended play style. I think the answer in every case is “no.” For that reason, I look forward to repeated attempts and improving at that.

I have perhaps five hours under my belt now on this revisit to the game. It's gotten its hooks into me to a surprising degree. The skills are much more impactful than I expected when first reviewing the options. They at first appear to be small percentage improvements like “+10 to dodge when moving.” Mathematically meaningful but not necessarily impactful to playstyle. They have compounding effects as you slot more points in, though. The keystone skills are also locked behind certain earlier combinations which gently prods you into a certain direction. There is variation in weapon drops that also gently nudges you into potential builds. So far I’ve gotten access to the same broad categories of weapons at roughly the same points. However, the weapons can drop with various levels of rarity. They can also be modified to be significantly improved. That’s coupled with a skill point every character level. In combination, there is opportunity for crafting a build as you go.

Weapon modding has been one of the particular joys so far. It’s comparatively easy to put together a very powerful weapon which you can rely on. They can be powerful enough to feel like you’ve broken the game a little bit at various points. That’s equalled by a pretty stiff difficulty curve 

Classes are meaningfully distinct as well. Each has a different resource, signature ability, and some passive traits -- enough to be a good baseline. But most of the skills are different for each class as well, including all of the keystone (“Master”) skills. When those are coupled with the class abilities, each class gets its own strong identify by around character level 6.

There are many quality-of-life inclusions which make play very smooth. Snappy input is the most important. The constraint to cardinal directions for movement is helpful especially on a console. Eight-directional movement is the undoing of every other console port of a traditional rogue like that I can think of.

Many different branches add variety. I don’t yet understand when I’d go to one branch over another but the variety alone is refreshing.

Ranged attacks are of course the thesis statement of the game. The game’s answer for this is probably primarily in the way it does intelligent auto-targeting. Enemy design also plays a role. There is a mix of ranged and melee enemies but they favor ranged. Cover is the other big piece of it. I remember cover being minimal or non-existent in [[Doom]] and Doom 2, and certainly non-existent in [[DOOM]] and following. Doom’s history has always been movement-as-defense. Things like Gears of War were almost specifically in contrast to this. JH does preserve this to a light degree in the Dodge stat. Moving reduces enemy chance to hit. JH adds tactical position to the mix though. Movement-to-defend is one path but cover is another. Builds support either. Bottom line, this tactical approach enables interesting ranged combat. Think [[XCOM]] for a shorthand.

All of this combines to create a game that executes its premise uniquely well. Doom and traditional rogue like shouldn’t work. Even if it does, it’s shouldn’t fit together so well, bringing out the best in both of its primary ingredients. But it does. It’s peanut butter and chocolate. I consider every move at times and yet I walk away feeling like I just runned-and-gunned.

Though this is a Switch port, meaning the game is running on average smart phone hardware from eight years ago, the performance is snappy and indistinguishable from the Steam Deck. The most important thing is that there is no input lag. The load times are also shockingly good. I always expected graphical downgrades on the Switch. Those are minimal if they exist at all. The game actually has a quite attractive look, especially the lighting system. But the big surprise is that loading times are nonexistent. This has been one area of continued pain on Switch. This port is masterful.

Ten runs in or so and I learn something every time I lose. Something about improved tactical approaches, valid builds, and strategic approaches to the branches. Continuing to appreciate the deep emphasis on playability. These are high quality craftsmen behind this work.

I’ve won one game now and it feels like it was due to a broken build. Melee Technician. I killed the final boss so fast that I never even got a chance to learn its mechanics.

This game is heavily informed by its developers' deep appreciation of what makes traditional roguelikes tick. I was first exposed to it by the hosts of the long-running “Roguelike Radio” podcast. So the pedigree is there. It has ample branches and that’s probably the key feature that’s kept me coming back so many times in a row. It also surprises once or twice a run with an item you didn’t see coming. I’m maybe twenty runs in and still occasionally finding a new item type, not just new items within a certain type. I’m also getting better at navigating the branches and figuring out how to maximize usage of them.

I usually die because of my pathological need to hoard healing items instead of using them. I wait too long to pop one because I’m trying to beat the curve of healing item usage to healing item spawn. I also use grenades infrequently. And often leave much of my class resource on the table. Basically, I’m playing poorly.

A lesson that’s finally, truly hit home by playing this game: What kills you is not poor use of consumables. What kills you is not having the wrong mix of ammo types. What kills you is running out of health.

There are some things that are balanced really well. (Especially coming from [[Shattered Pixel Dungeon]] which is essentially a solved game at my current skill level.) Weapons must usually be replaced soon after arriving in each new area. Baseline weapons are usable and weapons with one poorly-rolled mod are generally not worth keeping since that poorly-rolled mod takes up a slot another mod could use. Skills are generally useful at level 1, potent at level 2, and build-specific at level 3. It’s feasible depending on build to specialize in a few skills or to spread points around. Weapons have wildly different usefulness depending on build. Branches bring not only variety but also some guaranteed drops and some ability to tailor the threats you face based on your build. It is also sometimes reasonable to skip a branch or choose not to clear out a level. The combination of enemy types and player builds make terrain critically important throughout the entire game.

The game does a fabulous job of creating what John Harris calls “critical moments”: a situation where, if you do not carefully make an intelligent play on this turn, you could die. The CRI phase kits have incredible utility. At first glance they seem underpowered compared to how rare they are. But in my last game my run was saved by the use of a CRI phase kit during a critical moment.

I won my second run with a ranged build (Marine Bulletstorm) and this time it feels like I earned it. This was a pleasant comparison with the first run, with the Technician melee build, where it felt like I had tricked the game and gotten away with something unfair.
