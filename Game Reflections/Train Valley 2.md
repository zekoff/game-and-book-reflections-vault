More of a puzzle game than I was expecting. I believe on the Steam page that the game claims it’s a mix of “puzzle, micromanagement, and economic simulation” or something like that. And this is… precisely what it is. The puzzle element is primarily that if you set up your routes poorly, you can actually paint yourself into a corner where you don’t have enough money to set up new routes, but you also can’t make any more money because there’s no remaining demand on your existing routes.

The fact that the game has a pause when holding control chords, but not a traditional realtime pause, means I spend more than half the game hold e.g. the L button to engage the pause feature while I’m planning. I can’t think of any good for this tradeoff. It’s likely a playability concession for consoles and controllers, so I appreciate that it exists, but a dedicated button to toggle pause would have been better.
