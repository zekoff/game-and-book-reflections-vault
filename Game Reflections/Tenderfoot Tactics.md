Fascinating game. It exhibits a singular vision both in its artistic stylings and in its mechanics.

Visually and aurally it has an impressionistic and otherworldly feel. The music in battles is generally just endlessly repeated bars of a few notes, mixed with ambient sounds. It’s disconcerting but not aggressively so. The graphics follow this model. They use shadows and gradients but no textures. Figures are humanoid but with strange dimensions.

The open world fits exactly with this artistic approach. Land and sea shift and warp as your party moves around. You know only vaguely whats in the distance. An uncertain shape of land. A plume of smoke. Closer in, a stand of trees and a hill. There are maps, but navigation is done by comparing landmarks you can see with things marked on the maps -- no dot on a minimap showing where you are. There is also a bird that can fly up and give you a better vantage point. All of this makes it feel like you’re exploring and discovering even though the world is static.

The elemental and tick system are underutilized compared to the prominent spot they’re given in the UI. They’re also two of the most unique things about this game. I’m very surprised that they aren’t given top billing when making tactical considerations.

The tactical battle system has a few unique approaches and I’m not sure I appreciate how all of it works. I think I’ve finally parsed the use of the five “natural systems”. Each square has a distinct set of these attributes and the affect what will happen on that square. The most heavily-used by far at this point is the plant system. Tiles with high plant-per-tick numbers will grow bushes quickly. Bushes stop movement and so are very important. This means that a bush may pop up between a target and the goblin that you were going to attack with while other characters take their turns. It can upend an approach essentially by surprise. The reason it’s often a surprise is that, while each tile has a clear UI indication of how fast its natural systems are progressing, there isn’t UI support showing the current status of each tile relative to each natural system. There might be a few blades of grass showing, and you might know there’s heavy plant growth on a tile, but you won’t know exactly when a bush will sprout. It makes it difficult to plan ahead. This interacts with the otherwise deterministic approach to combat. Damage numbers are fixed, movement range is the same for all characters, and there are no line-of-sight systems. It’s much cleaner and parseable than the [[XCOM]] model. Each entity also clearly lists its abilities, status effects, and health.

Battles are often quite difficult, but failure isn’t costly, as you’re just returned to the location at which you most recently camped with no other penalties.

Powerful skill and class system. The base class can respec skills at any time for free. There are also advanced classes unlocked by having certain levels in one or more other classes.

The one major issue as I’m playing is that the UI is painfully small in handheld mode for Switch. I have to hold the screen close to my face to make sense of symbols in tactical battles.

I came back to the game over and over for days. The tactical battles grew on me as I understood them better. The exploration was unexpectedly compelling -- elevated specifically because navigation could only be done by comparing maps to landmarks. I had a sudden glimmer of the world’s lore when I realized that the fog centered on fae weed. A character in a town remarked that goblins lost themselves when spending too much time in the fog. And skills are forgotten through the use of fae week, tying together those bits of lore. The game became hypnotic. Shifting landscapes, uncertain elemental effects, vague maps, otherworldly characters, familiar-but-disconcerting factions.

Then, the game crashed, and the hypnosis was broken. I felt no need to go back.
