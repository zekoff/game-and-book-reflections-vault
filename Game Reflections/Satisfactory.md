I believe I played this on Steam Deck at some point. I purchased it on recommendation but have heard about it for years. It’s hard to tell after a half hour what’s so special about it. I know that [[Factorio]]-like gameplay is ahead of me. I’ve also heard that where Factorio emphasizes tower defense, Satisfactory emphasizes exploration. That sounds great. In my first few minutes I’ve had run-ins with simplistic enemies and whacked them with a wrench. Building placement has been finicky since it’s done from first-person perspective. The UI has been barely adequate to the task so far. I struggled to find options like pinning recipe materials to the HUD. The manual crafting interface seems buggy. Lights flicker and progress bars reset while holding the craft button, but behave smoothly when activating them using other approaches in the UI.

I need to fast-forward to the “good parts” soon if I’m ever going to get there. The game definitely front-loaded some bad parts.
