Incredible what a different experience it is to have a twin-stick shooter without a dodge roll or other i-frame ability. My recollection is that this feature has come standard on twin-stick shooter roguelikes since [[Enter the Gungeon]].

Full on bullet hell. Interesting shot patterns.

Completed a full run after about 5 attempts. Used the basic or starter mech (the first one in the list, described as having no special traits besides high health). After the completed run, I tried one of the more unusual ones -- a mech for which time only advances for anything in the game when the player mech is active, either by shooting or by moving. This was neat and I could see this being a fun way to play. There’s a lot of game here if you get into exploring the various mechs.

I do like how this game is a roguelike versus a rogue-lite: there are no meta progression elements that make the player more powerful between runs. There do appear to be additional things that you can unlock which presumably add items to the various random item pools.

This is a very Arcen game. The graphics are ugly -- not low-res, but not having any particular art direction. They look like they come from freeware asset packs. So too, is the UI functional but just that. The initial loading screen of the game is also a simple text line counting up the 5000-odd assets as they’re being loaded. I also went into the options and zoomed out the play field, which did make the biggest difference in improving my enjoyment of the game.

As to what’s special about this game… it’s hard to say. Probably there is a wealth of content in the form of mechs. The moment-to-moment shooting is fine, although twin-stick shooters are not typically my favorites. Perhaps this game is a product of its age? …after Googling briefly though, this was released in 2016. That’s too for it to have been cutting edge for its time. I also saw a note that poor sales after this game led to layoffs within Arcen, which is a shame. I’m wondering what the developer saw as the special sauce for this game.

Not specifically related to this game, but I read a commenter on Steam saying something to the effect of “I’m glad Arcen makes these games, even though I don’t always like them myself.” I identify with that sentiment as well.
