Arresting and unusual game. It is firmly informed by games -- there is crafting, weapon degradation, survival and hunger systems, 3D-Zelda-style-lock-on-combat. But there’s also sailing, which is unusual. I’ve still never played [[Wind Waker]], so maybe there’s a close touchpoint there I’m simply not familiar with. And it’s… artsy?

The structure of the game is… roguelite-like? There are apparently five chapters. Between chapters you can spend a currency to give yourself bonuses like a permanent spear, so there is some upgrading. At the beginning of the game you choose between difficulty modes, one of which is sort of the story mode, and the other seems to be more roguelite-like.

The artistic direction (including music and sound) is striking. Bold colors and flat textures, rolling waves, lightning flashes in walls of clouds. The music swells while sailing long distances between islands, and the sailing strikes a neat balance between relaxing and engaging. You trim your sails to catch the wind, but it’s not terribly intense gameplay and so allows for the enjoyment of the way the wind fights against your boat.

The underworld-type area between island groups uses haunting colors, with a cosmic-horror leviathan appearing as you sail. The music track in this area is repetitive but intense and unsettling, with a percussive piano melody high on the keyboard.

The biggest thing holding the game back is that every action feels just slightly off. Combat is just barely serviceable, the UI has a frame or two of lag every time you take an action in the crafting menu, and the platforming is a little unwieldy. The game turns out to be exactly the sum of its parts, and that’s what keeps it from being a cult classic. If each of the components were polished just one or two more passes, this game would end up being greater than the sum of its considerable parts. It would be elevated to “can’t miss” instead of “neat oddity.”

Played for about 2-3 hours. Feel like I understand the game loop fully. The crafting and combat system are scaling bigger and outward, so even though I’m in area 3 of 5, I think I’m probably less than halfway done, and I don’t think the game has double the things left to teach before. I’ve exhausted the game systems before the story. Raph Koster would have something to say about this.
