A wonderful surprise. The experience of this game is why I’m so willing to take chances on unproven products. This is, very broadly, an isometric action RPG like [[Diablo]] or perhaps more [[Hades]]. It’s solid and its X-factors are a combat grappling hook as well as a huge variety of weapons. Ultimately that is the main game because everything else feeds into it. Yet it’s paired with a polished [[Animal Crossing]]-like town builder. Building the town is frictionless and provides opportunities for farming, fishing, friendships, home decoration, mining, crafting, and cooking. (Maybe even a few other things that just aren’t coming to mind.) The town building is fun on its own and it yields resources which are eventually pumped back into combat capabilities.

It includes server-based multiplayer. The theme is bright and is tongue-in-cheek but not sarcastic. A story of AI run amok and humanity now fighting for good-guy robots against bad-guy robots. I bought extra copies to play with Jack and Emma Cate. Each of them finds the theme palatable and are enjoying the game for different reasons. Predictably, Emma Cate is enjoying the town building while Jack enjoys the combat missions. Both are participating in each side though.

The moment-to-moment use of the grappling hook gives the combat immediate flair. It makes the movement important and varied. The variety in weapons yields something close to the variety of class choices in other action RPGs. The roguelike run nature of each mission makes it reasonable to experiment freely with different weapon types.

Perhaps 15 hours in and I’m still enjoying myself tremendously. I am seeing the outlines of how grindy this game will be, however. Upgrades have become very expensive and my power growth has stalled at the same time. I can still progress more through the campaign missions but the side missions have become nearly uncompleteable due to their numerical difficulty.
