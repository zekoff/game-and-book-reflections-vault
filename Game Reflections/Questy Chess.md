Puzzle game on Playdate with a pawn as avatar. Cute framing with the pawn trying to defend his 1.0 home version from getting updated to 2.0. Strange in that it has an inventory which appears to carry over between levels. In my short time I didn’t hit a level which needed carryover inventory to complete. It acts, I guess, as another set of tools for solving puzzles. I do think that’s clever. I’ve only played a few minutes, so my views might evolve if I return to it.
