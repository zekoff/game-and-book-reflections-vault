Very special. Headphones are indeed important. Truly accomplishes synaesthesia. There are two ways that it seems to accomplish this. First, the music to each stage transitions at specific points. When you complete the final lines that send you over an invisible threshold, a new track will be added to the music at the next available measure. It connects what’s happening mechanically with what you hear. Second and more powerful is that each time you manipulate a Tetrimino it comes with an additional note or staccato musical flourish. It feels like you’re contributing to the music. I occasionally would even idly and thoughtlessly manipulate a piece just as part of engaging with the music.

I like the Zone mechanic as well. It feels like a lifeline but not quite cheating because it doesn't trivialize anything. It helps with one of the very few problems with Tetris. When you start to fall behind because you left holes, it's hard to dig yourself out again. This mechanic helps with recovery while still making you earn it.
