A tight classical roguelike. The hook is that there are probably 20 different yokai that double as both player classes and enemies. Fairly tight food clock. Unique level up mechanic. On each floor there is a single pacifist NPC. Upon killing it a level-up is granted. Fighting normal enemies grants nothing. They are simply obstacles and thus fleeing is an option.

There are two sets of stairs on each floor. As I become better at the game, I believe one of the keys will be learning the balance between finding the level-up NPC and then diving, or searching the floor for additional items. The inventory space is extremely limited: five slots shared between equipment, consumables, and the useless scrolls which are the win condition.

The other hook is that making it to the bottom of the dungeon means that you unlock new yokai based on how many and which scrolls you have carried to the bottom on that run.

Extremely difficult. Looks like when I first played in 2020 I only ever completed a run or two. During this second install I have only even made it halfway through the dungeon at best and sometimes even died on the first floor.
