Growing ability to project out what a game will be like many hours into it. I could choose to settle in and enjoy the game but it's unlikely to provide a new experience. This game is perfectly competent. I’d be proud to have made it myself.

Skill points advancement is incremental. There is a simple tree. Maxing out each node gives something like a 15% bonus to the associated domain. This isn't appealing as the primary advancement mechanism. It works better as a Paragon system as seen in the newer [[Diablo]] games. The long term incremental improvements are a passive dopamine drip where you look back and feel you've accomplished something. As a build crafting system this approach lacks punch. A smaller number of significant perks gives more noticeable milestones and feels like a character is advancing in chunks.

In this game, however, the skill advancement is only one type of advancement. The acquisition of materials and crafting of items is a more significant advancement loop.

I'm concerned I'll end up in the loop of wandering aimlessly for a vein of a progression stopping ore. There is a user experience innovation for this in the form of twinkles in the darkness. The character can be lost in pitch dark but the player can still see sparkles onscreen deep in the walls. These are always some kind of ore vein. That helps. It contrasts with [[Minecraft]] where the experience of playing survival is monotonous mining at random until a drip of three ore blocks appears followed by more monotonous mining. Endless empty hallways dug out with an endless series of stone picks.

Another courteous innovation is that holding down the mining button will see your character step forward a tile each time they finish mining a block. So you can simply hold that one button down and dig that endless tunnel. This makes the mindless activity actually mindless. 

Combat is a standard, simplified approach similar to classic top-down [[The Legend of Zelda series|Zelda]] games. One button to swing a sword, hold that to charge, and a button for any offhand equipment. Enemies telegraph their attacks and it’s important to mitigate damage from them when possible. Positioning can be difficult because entities slide around a little bit and because. Combat is frequent. There’s too much emphasis on it compared to how engaging it is. Strip it away and there’s no threat -- the game would lose some friction and an important resource and advancement sink. Some kind of extra spice would be nice to set it apart from the many, many other games like this.

Lighting effects are beautiful. The off-grid shader used on terrain tiles adds variety to the way things look.
