Typewriter tape as a limited consumable in order to save the game -- there's a design element that won't be coming back!

Tank controls and painfully slow turning only added to the horror of this game. I've heard it said that true horror is the feeling of powerlessness. Whether by design or accident, the controls effectively contributed to that horror.
