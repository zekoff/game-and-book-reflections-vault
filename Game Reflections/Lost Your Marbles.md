Cute, and excellent use of the Playdate’s crank. The sound effect of the rolling marble is particularly pleasant. I appreciate how the levels are very zoomed in, light puzzles, and they often are themed around the problem that the characters are trying to solve, like a billiards table when having to pick a “sports ball”, or a diner when having to pick a food. I also especially like how all of the possible answers in the puzzle section have generated some humorous dialogue afterwards. When I’ve picked the “right” answer, like mayo as the condiment for a sandwich instead of candle wax, I’m gotten an equally absurd yet fitting dialogue response compared to when I’ve selected the “wrong” thing, like picking a hockey puck as my sports ball.

Completed the story in just over an hour. At the end of the credit roll, it showed a checklist of what I'd completed on each level… and crucially, the entire levels I'd missed. Nothing could have gotten me more interested in continuing to play after completing it.

I am shocked at the quality level of the Season 1 Playdate games. The craftsmanship is impeccable. Likely something driven by the extraordinary constraints of the platform, yet the level of creativity is matched by the cleverness, economy, insight, and wisdom of the design choices in these games.
