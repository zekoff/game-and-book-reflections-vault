Demo. Falcom jank. I bet it will be good.

…now after playing about 20 minutes. Heavy on exposition. Static models and ponderous animations. Odd moments for voiceover from the lead character and otherwise silent. It must be deliberate but I can’t tell why this was the choice. He’s not utterly silent in the tradition of JRPG protagonists, but he doesn’t talk nearly as much as any other character which results in him being kind of a wet blanket.

The combat seems like it will be satisfying once more options open up. The parry mechanic already shines because it comes with VFX and SFX that pop.

Ultimately I am not going to invest the dozens of hours in a game where every cutscene is slightly offputting. Though I hate to miss out on the combat and progression systems.
