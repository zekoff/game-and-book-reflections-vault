Striking character portraits and general art style. I was almost put off of this game since it was billed as having “lightning-fast combat” but I’ve found this to be not entirely true.

There is some “spell crafting” sort of feel in the way that your spells are altered by adding Gambits to them.

25 attempts over 16 hours to complete my first run. Very little frustration. Felt like I was continually mastering the systems bit by bit over those runs, and that my failed runs were my own fault instead of a bad streak of RNG.

The cycling spell system is clever. It provides consistent variety but also you can make it reliable in your own way. It provides rhythm. A rhythm to combat each single run, yet great variety to distinguish one run from another.

35 attempts over 25 hours to beat Destiny 6 difficulty, which rolls the credits and concludes the story. I had achieved a level of mastery over the build-crafting elements of the game that allowed me to accelerate through the end and beat the final boss in his final form the very first time I encountered him. (I achieved this by carefully stacking to the maximum armor value of 70% damage reduction through a combination of Stone Altars and an Aura that granted armor.

As far as I can tell, armor works inversely to the way all other stat increases work in this game. Armor gives “reverse damage vulnerability” on a linear scale from 100% baseline to the capped minimum of 30%. Each armor stone you pick up reduces your damage vulnerability by 3% (so, gives you 3% additional armor in the way that the game describes it). This means the first armor stone you pick up gives you 3% additional effective health. But the last armor stone you pick up, taking your vulnerability from 33% down to 30%, gives you a 10% increase in effective health. So stacking armor to the cap has greater and greater benefits. The last stone you pick up has more than triple the value of the first stone you pick up.

Compare against Strength stones in the game (or Health, or Crit, or Attack Speed). Each Strength stone gives you 5% additional damage. So the first stone you pick up takes you from 100% damage potential to 105% damage potential, a 5% increase. The 21st stone you pick up takes you from 200% damage potential to 205% damage potential, which is only a 2.5% increase. The 21st stone is half the value of the first stone.

What this also means is that it makes some sense (in absence of any other factors) to roughly balance the number of strength stones you pick up versus Attack Speed stones, in absence of any other considerations. The marginal increase of each next stone is less the more you have, so by keeping the two in rough alignment you are maximizing if you only can choose between the two. However, there are other factors in the game that make Crit or Attack Speed more valuable. Several Auras and Signature Ability upgrades interact off of crits: when a crit occurs, a second effect then also occurs. This obscures the value of each crit point but also means that you can create an exponential power ramp by stacking crit along with these abilities. Attack speed can play a role here too, as more attacks mean more chances to get a crit, plus the fact that each landed basic attack restores a tick of mana, so faster attacks mean more mana to spend on spells. Since spells tend to be significantly more powerful than basic attacks, this gives attack speed an obscured but greater value. My guess is that if I really finished theorycrafting this out, Strength might be slightly underpowered, with one exception: since it also apparently empowers spells, which are themselves very powerful, it may work well with builds heavy on spells (so long as you have sufficient mana regen somehow).

Back to armor: the approach to armor in Astral Ascent is different from armor in [[Warframe]]. An armor amount in Warframe is translated to a damage reduction value behind the scenes. The first 100 points of armor give you 25% damage reduction. The next 100 points of armor take your damage reduction to 33% (so, only give you an 8% increase in damage reduction). Continuing to stack armor has diminishing returns. There is no cap to how much armor you can stack, it’s just that every point contributes less to the total damage reduction you achieve. My guess is that the graph of Effective Health is linear as you add linearly increasing amounts of armor. In AA, where each armor stone just reduces the next flat amount of damage vulnerability, the graph of your effective health is exponential rather than linear for every additional point of armor.

This is the way stat increases like Crit work (or worked, last time I cared) in [[World of Warcraft]]. Each point of Crit, when translated into a final value of “likelihood of critical hit occurring,” had a diminishing return. This is a slightly different phenomenon than the idea of soft and hard crit caps. Hard caps mean “after this level, any extra point is wasted”. Soft caps mean “after this level, any extra point suddenly has a dramatically decreased benefit.”

Hold attack to auto spam basic attack.

After I completed the true ending, I checked the hub area to see all of the new optional difficulty modifiers I had unlocked, and then deleted the game. I could certainly play this game for dozens more hours as I haven’t seen all of the amped-up Zodiacs from Destiny 6 yet, but I also just picked it as a time to move on the next thing. Now that I’ve thought through all of this though… maybe I’ll re-install.
