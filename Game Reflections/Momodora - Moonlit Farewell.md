Played about an hour. Not for me. There was an early nod towards a relationship system. This implies that the characters have a place of importance in the game's design. I won't care about these characters so that was an early data point. The first ability unlocked allowed me to slash vines. The second allowed me to sprint. If double jump is retained as a big reveal three or more ability unlocks in, it's unlikely the game will later floor me with its unique traversal and combat options. The mechanical augmentations are important to me. The idea of new abilities recontextualizing the map is the hallmark of a strong metroidvania. It takes increasingly more to stand out now. The effect of Dan Cook’s genre dilemma. I also appreciate abilities that are woven into all aspects of the game. A new ability should have both combat and traversal uses at a minimum. Not so here. Sigils are the games modifier system for character abilities and are underwhelming based on the first four I unlocked. Here again, unless the game hits the gas hard very soon, the sigils are too bland to make a difference. The art and animation are well crafted. It seems that this game is meant to tilt narrative. Since I'm not invested in the narrative I won't find what I'm looking for here.
