Tabletop game, played with one other player so far. Iterates on the deck-building genre by adding a game board with tactical movement.

Adventure Row: similar to something I prototyped in a cooperative parenting game, where quests are drawn and laid out to be shared by players. I think a similar approach also appeared in Star Realms (and maybe Ascension?), where the tableau of available cards changes as players purchase them.

Deck building: certainly stands in the shadow of Dominion, but the approach of simply always playing all cards in hands feels a little better. There’s a rule indicating that the order of card play doesn’t matter, which adds to the feeling of flexibility. I sense that this loosens up the design space a good bit, ultimately de-emphasizing the exact card draws per turn, which is good since it has to split cognitive burden with movement across the board.

Tactical board: the overarching goal (hack your way into Command, steal an artifact, and then escape) gives a natural arc to the game which is helpful to guide deck building and also makes the various phases of the game more explicit. One of the key player skills in Dominion is intuiting when you should phase transition from engine-building your deck into cashing in for victory points. This is a difficult skill to pick up on, and probably a big differentiator in player skill. The more explicit phasing in CIS means it’s clearer what phase the game is in -- as the rage ticks up, you understand clearly how much pressure is on and you can calibrate yourself accordingly. Seeing the tactical layout also brings in more explicit tactical and strategic play. Tactical: I can make it to that data port next turn if I ensure that I have at least one boot, etc. Strategic: the rage timer is high, so I will plan to work towards a Teleporter key that will enable my escape route, and I’ll grab that artifact near the teleport pad somehow.

Semi-cooperative: game allows for some small spectrum between cutthroat and cooperative play. This would be player-dependent, but for instance if you sprint for the end you can hang your competing thieves out to dry by forcing additional cube draws and damage. Lauren and I on the other hand actually paced our escapes (honor among thieves) so that we’d escape within one turn of each other and not cause the other to suffer a game-ending attack from the boss. We also chose not to purchase cards from the adventure row near the end, since that would have potentially opened up slots for boss attacks and neither of us could really soak those attacks near the end.

Balance/tuning: it’s way too early for me to say what strategies are effective, but in our first game together, Lauren and I ended with final scores of 104 and 108. With all the moving parts, we both expected the potential for wide variation in scores. I am pleasantly surprised how close the game ended up being.
