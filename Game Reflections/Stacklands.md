This entry refers to the Switch port, after having played the PC version a year or more ago on Steam Deck. It suffers very slightly from not having mouse input. Overall though the controls are serviceable and the input works better on console than I would have predicted. The game itself is unusual and has a veneer of simplicity but actually a fairly complicated resource management system under the hood. You play against a ticking clock which escalates threats based on number of in-game days that pass. That said, the game doesn’t even tip its hand that there are threats until probably an hour in on each “run”. I also just in this port triggered the final boss early by not knowing what I was doing, and got suitably destroyed.

I hadn’t thought of this game in its original incarnation as run-based. I’m seeing more now though that supports this idea. There are dozens and dozens of unlockable cards and still enough randomness in the basic system that I’m confident I haven’t come close to seeing everything. I also suspect that there will be new, branching methods of engaging with a run after I complete my first one.
