Great introduction to the console. Score attack style, virtually no depth, but with utter reliance on the crank as the input mechanism. Very doubtful I’ll put any significant time into it, but a reasonable first showpiece for the console. The graphics are slick within their bounds and the music is a good fit for the game.

Since I’ve returned to the game a couple of times over the last several days, my top score has grown by three orders of magnitude. That’s a neat trick in itself, and I credit the game with having more than I initially was willing to dig into.
