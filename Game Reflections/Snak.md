Zach Gage is a designer who’s been on my radar since [[SpaceChem]]. When I saw his name I was intrigued. But then I loaded up the game and it was… just snake? With some weird way that enemies would spawn, move, and latch onto your snake. I lost a game because I crashed into myself. So far so standard. Then I lost my first game because the latched enemies climbed up to my head. I was confused and disappointed since there was no way I could affect that short of perfectly intercepting each enemy. At some point I backed out to the title screen again and saw a “how to play” prompt. One of the buttons causes the snake’s head to jump. I cannot overstate how this elevated the game. Jumping allows you to cross your own body, the equivalent of a cheat code for Nokia Snake. And now the enemies climbing up your body make sense -- you must jump over your body at the time an enemy is passing that section so that you can eat it. This simple addition of bringing a third dimension changes everything. Extremely clever, and suddenly I saw the Zach Gage connection.
