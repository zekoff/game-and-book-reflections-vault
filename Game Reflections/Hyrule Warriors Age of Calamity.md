Played demo to start with. Apes [[The Legend of Zelda - Breath of the Wild|BotW]]’s sound, interface, items, and character designs incredibly well. Link even enters slow motion when aiming his bow while airborne. Fun 1-vs-100 combat as expected.

Now, playing the full-fat version, it’s surprising that I slept on this game so long. The core gameplay is solid as expected. The mission design is varied in objectives even using the core loop, and the sequences with the Divine Beasts don’t quite work mechanically, but they are effective at capturing the cratering power of these thematically -- something that even BotW didn’t really do. That the Divine Beasts are so obviously on a different level is really something when in the context of a game where you might literally kill 1,000 enemies in one mission with just a standard character.

The most recent thing I hit was the Master Sword sequence. It gave me a fiero moment. How can I complement it more strongly than that? Link pulls the sword, you hear the treasure fanfare, and then, so fitting for the over-the-top heroism of this game, you go immediately back into a battle sequence to the beat of the LttP overworld theme and you lay waste to shadow monsters that had you on the ropes only moments before.
