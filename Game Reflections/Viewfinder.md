Mind-Bending. For the first half hour or so, every time I thought that I had seen through the game's magic trick, it did another trick. I flipped between grinning at the game's creativity and scratching my head at its puzzles.

The game did make me borderline motion sick at times. 

I'm reminded of [[The Witness]]. I advance not because I have new skills in the game but because I understand the same thing differently. What changes is not my avatar but me the player. The act of controlling my avatar is a need because of my advancing understanding as the player. 

I've already had one moment of "did I break the game with that solution or was I just meant to feel smart?”

Shockingly clever. I don't know why more people aren't talking about this game.
