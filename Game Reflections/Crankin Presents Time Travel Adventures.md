Unusual game with a coherent and singular vision, and an excellent showpiece for the Playdate. You realize a few “dates” (levels) into the game that it’s a puzzle game. Mechanically its only input is a one-axis analog stick, i.e. the crank. It takes an odd approach to collisions in that it uses pixel-perfect collision detection. It leans on this by having obstacles and enemies which require you to position yourself via exact frames of animation to avoid the obstacle. In that way, it’s like the Japanese game show where contestants have to contort themselves into very specific positions to avoid oncoming walls with particular cutouts.
