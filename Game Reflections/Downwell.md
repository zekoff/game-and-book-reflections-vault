Another great showcase for NS2 TATE mode. I put quite a bit of time into this game years ago. One of the best at capturing a risk/reward dynamic. There is great satisfaction in stringing together a long combo of jumps. As you get better at the game you realize that those long combos are the only thing that will actually lead to success. But the greed of building a long combo also pushes you into dangerous situations.

The roguelike perks eventually just blend together into a mush like with most examples of the modern run-based game. Each run is an act of collecting too many perks to keep them straight. You just play like you always do each run.
