The critical consensus has been mixed and slanting negative. The warmest receptions have been “the game is good.” The coolest receptions have been “this game desecrates the very franchise.”

This game is excellent. It takes so much of the complicated cruft that has accumulated over the years and trims it back while maintaining most of the signature decision making.

There are two things that came through clearly for me. First, a drive to support the way people should be playing Civ to maximize their enjoyment. Second, an attempt to truly take a new approach to Civ while still maintaining its essence.

This is the most extendable framework I remember ever seeing in a Civ game. Add new Ages. Make them wacky. Add the sci-fi age. Add the high fantasy age. Add the vampires and zombies age. Add new Quarters. Make special quarters buildable out of more flexible building combinations. Add new buildings. Add new leaders, civs, and units of course. New Civic trees. New Legacy paths. More quests and narrative events. Different types of independent powers. This will be an absolute feast for modders.

Coming back and starting a new game on Switch 2 after several patches. I can see the intent of the game more clearly now. One of the things I do like is the district system. It rewards planning ahead and knowing the different buildings that will become available. It’s actually deceptively complex. The weakness of that is that you must have a good understanding of all the buildings that will be available in order to play your city effectively. The thing I’m enjoying the least is something that I didn’t appreciate until now. There a lot of popups each turn. Other leaders asking for diplomatic actions inserts constant friction from one turn to the next. I think the UI is meant to be simplified and approachable but it hides too much of the options. There is also a problem inherent to a console port in that it’s simply not as seamless as with a mouse. I should try mouse mode for a while and see what I think.

Despite my earliest positive reactions, I actually haven’t returned often to this game. I’ve had plenty of others to play and perhaps that’s part of it. But as an alternate example I’ve returned to [[Jupiter Hell]] over and over between other games. It could have something to do with the fact that Civ is a game you buckle up for. It’s not a drop-in-and-drop-out game. It certainly still has that “one more turn” compulsion.

I'm fascinated trying to figure out why I don't like this game. Something about the magic is gone. It could be that I'm simply tired of the Civ formula. It could be the age transitions although I don't think so. There's a chance it's the aesthetic trappings although I do love zooming in on my cities. It could be the simplification of cities or the absence of workers. I played many many hours of 4, 5, and 6, especially 4 and 6.

I’d like to keep tackling this challenge of “why don’t I like this?” by comparing it to [[UnCiv]]. I’ve been playing a lot of UC recently and loving it. UC is a pure and beautiful implementation of the final state of Civ 5 (the inclusion of the Gods and Kings expansion). I played many hours of Civ 5 when it was the contemporary release. Not by any means enough to compare the experience in perfect detail from memory. Parity is however the developer’s stated goal and it certainly fits from my memory. Regardless, UC standing on its own is a phenomenal implementation of Civ regardless.

Civ 4: unknown as I apparently didn’t play it through Steam, but based on the numbers below I’d guess 30-40 hours

Civ 5: 58 hours

[[Civilization VI]]: 54 hours (although I played many, many more hours on the Switch so this is clearly the winner overall)

\[Brief interlude: I have apparently logged almost twice the number of hours in [[Dominions 5 - Rise of the Pantokrator]], 188, than I have in my Steam copies of both Civ 5 and 6 combined. That seems… impossible?! But then… I guess I did buy a printed copy of the Dominions 5 manual expressly for putting on my bookshelf.\]

A useful approach might be to measure C7 against the “neutral color” of UC. That may help me define what changes could be made to make C7 more-Civ without making it less-C7. C7 is its own direction and its entitled to it. In other words, what would the best version of C7 be, the version that expresses its intent perfectly? (The possibility exists that C5/UC is the local maxima where Civ as we know it most fully achieves its essence of being. Platonic Civilization. Perhaps a different starting point could have led to an alternate-universe Civ series that eclipses ours. But we have the Civ we have.)

Lets boil down to a list of the top five? seven? problems to solve with C7. Ideally most of them should be things core to the design of C7 because the goal is not to turn it into a different game. The goal of the analysis is to create a more perfect C7, not a retrofitted UC. But there may be problems that aren’t core to the design and it’s also useful to identify those. UI issues or performance problems are important and its useful to disambiguate those from the underlying mechanics of the design.

We’ll also need a list of the top things that identify C7. Its thesis statements, its pillars, the things that say “here is what C7 does to make it an intentionally different experience from previous versions.” On this rock I will build my church.

Problems:
- UI
- Loss of “one more turn” compulsion
- Pacing
- Dissociation of diplomacy from the other resources

Pillars:

- Streamline decisions to only the “important” ones, reduce the level of micromanagement especially in the later stages of the game
- Commander system falls out of this
- Removal of workers falls out of this
- Address the inherent problem that to make the biggest and most successful civ, you will be signing up for increasing amounts of micromanaging (which is not where most people find the fun, see Soren Johnson’s “players will optimize the fun out of the game)
- Ages system
- The separation of leaders and nations falls out from this primarily
- The hard transitions

The more I play the more I realize how much disservice the UI does this game. The console controls are extremely non-native. However, I tried playing with touch controls for a while in handheld mode. That didn’t help much either. There are also still UI bugs that absolutely shouldn’t be here in a game which has been out for this long. The UI is so bad that it’s the single biggest barrier between me and playing more.

Pacing again seems off. In my last game I played on the third difficulty from the bottom (third easiest). I was the subject of a war on two fronts which I spent the whole first age trying to avoid. I also saw when it was coming and began to use recon to place my units strategically. I had enough placed to ward off an attack plus a group staged for a counterstrike on the enemy capital. When they surprise declared a war, I had very little war weariness advantage (amounting to a 1 point combat strength bonus with units carrying ~30 strength innately). The enemy then proceeded to roll over me with dozens and dozens of units. I lost a city and they could have taken more. Then one civ declared a surprise end to their war and gave me a city. Baffling.

Most importantly in that game I poured everything into civics and didn’t get even a single Future Civic. I don’t even think I was the leading Civics nation, and in every other category of resource generation I was last or close to it.

I really don’t like not knowing how terrain will affect my combat strength.

Easy fix: allow three buildings per tile instead of two, and also create bonuses for districts that combine certain buildings.

What’s weird is that the system of population creating rural improvements is pretty close to equivalent with adding pop in previous civ games. Add a pop, a new tile can be worked. It’s that simple.

The district system really requires knowing what buildings will be available and planning ahead. I also HATE that I can’t get more information on what buildings I already have in a tile. If I can’t tell from a tiny thumbnail picture what building I have somewhere, then I’m out of luck.

Trade is a little anemic in unvic. They did flesh it out into a new and more complex system in civ 7 question. It's not clear whether that made it better though

Diplomacy is always also an area I haven't explored much as I think about these games

And civ 7. I definitely do feel like I am playing against other entities, not just bland computer opponents

The UI in UC is very effective. Things are highly linked. Information is available quickly with single taps. However, this is a dramatic advantage of a touch interface over a controller interface. More could be done with the controller than is. However, civ 7 has hamstrung itself by being beautiful and in air quotes accessible in their quote. One of the things that makes controller games accessible can be the lack of inputs to remember. Either put all of the inputs on the screen or don't have so many people have to memorize things like particular cord presses to go deeper on topics. Do make things less accessible from a input standpoint, but more accessible from an information standpoint 

Civ 7 has a quest system which is unnecessary and potentially clouds what your real objective should be. Quest results don't seem powerful enough to pursue on their own

The console version of civ 7 sure seems like it has to do a lot of under the hood number crunching every time I hit intern, I am on turn 8 of a new game. I have one city and one scout. When I press next turn the game spins about 5 seconds before it gives control back to me. In UC pressing in turn effectively instantly provides me with my new turn Even late into the game with five civilizations and eight city-states each civilization having maybe five or six cities and dozens of units started around the map

The scale might be something wrong in 7. Units move two or one tile per turn oven with roads. This makes cities of any size monstrous to traverse. A military unit could take 5 turns to get from the cities frontier to a district on its other side. So hundreds of in game years in the ancient era. But then crossing the wilderness between cities is no slower. Odd. Also cities now feel too big even though they are now beautiful to look at. Two buildings per district is extremely limiting and they never did with it what I thought was going to be the headlining feature. That combinations of buildings have unique effects. Like combining a garden and a market make a pleasure district or a sawmill and a brickyard make an industrial district. Instead it all comes back to adjacency bonuses which seem of modest power at best and are very difficult to plan around. 

Three buildings per district might have been a better approach than two. Less limiting and addresses some of the scale issues. As I recall you could only have a limited number of districts in 6 and it scaled logarithmically based on your population. A new district was a major moment and also forced city specialization. 

 The cities look beautiful.

The social and metagame elements of the game are a disaster. Leveling up Benjamin Franklin is one of the dumbest, grindiests, a-thematic things I've seen. Getting a notification of Internet disconnection upon resuming every switch session is obnoxious. Portrait unlocks

Modifiers split across too many places to have coherence. Leader modifiers innate, memento modifiers, leader skill points, and civ traits. On top of social and tech advancement which already provide these things. 

The UI is colossal disaster. Shows me few of the things, lots of things I don't, I need and the things it does so are cramped. Also unreliable. Moving the cursor with the d pad is finicky, tooltips are finicky, buttons change functions depending on what menu you're in, tap is intermittently functional. 

Pace seems so off now. I played an ancient era game where I accomplished less than a quarter of any legacy goal and had the lowest stats in every category across civs while also getting stomped in a row front war neither of which I declared. And in fact repeated tried to stop by spending influence. Pumped war weariness too. In another game I sailed accidentally to multiple legacy path completions while not even trying. I can't imagine how I'd have played differently in the game where I was stomped so hard. Then the age reset and everyone still hated me. Miserable. 

Quality assurance is like no one had played a civ game deeply before. Loss of right thumb stick click on console.
