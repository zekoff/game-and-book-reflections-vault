Looking forward to playing on this on better hardware than Switch 1.

Playing now on Switch 2 but still a Switch 1 version. It runs marginally better and the load times are tolerable. Things are good enough that I’ve been able to sink my teeth in, logging about 20 hours now.

This game is secretly amazing. I keep thinking of [[The Legend of Zelda - Breath of the Wild|The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild]] as I explore the genuinely open world. The map is enormous. It seems that there are distinct sections of the world and they are likely gated between each other. Otherwise though the game feels very open. The lack of BotW’s climbing mechanic here actually shows how much of a difference that made for its game. Often I’ll know where I want to go but be unable to figure out the “right” way. There’s a very generous triple-jump that can be used against walls. Most walls also have little physics geometry oddities that allow a short pause and triple jump refresh. Thus, it’s possible to scale many walls in a way that feels unpleasantly like sequence-breaking. But if anything that speaks to the true openness of the maps. The map is littered with points of interest and not all of them are obvious in their workings. There are even two different “hacking” minigames that crop up from time to time. The points of interest range from minor totems hidden in plain sight all the way to full-scale abandoned ruins which can be explored and which contain their own simple environmental puzzles to solve.

Yumia has a gun which also significantly changes the game compared to Ryza. It is used for a few things. It can hit targets around which puzzles can be built. It can remotely gather things that would otherwise have to be struck with a staff. It can be used to stagger enemies with a few shots prior to a fight. And then there are additional ammo types I’m unlocking like a powerful blast. It also starts with a scan shot which will show the level and drops from an enemy.

The alchemy was a little bewildering at first but I’m starting to get it. Recipes consist of simple shapes like circles and triangles. Along the shape will be nodes where ingredients can be placed. Ingredients create a radius around the node in which they are placed. If the radius overlaps other nodes, the power of the item increases. That’s the core. Ingredients can confer their own benefits, certain nodes resonate more strongly with certain ingredients, etc. It feels good to create strong items although I get the ever so slight consumable panic knowing that whatever I spend is not recoverable.
