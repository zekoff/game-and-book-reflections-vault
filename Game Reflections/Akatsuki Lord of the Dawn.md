Striking music at the title screen. The arced side-on terrain gives the game a distinctive look.

There’s quite a number of moving parts to this game. An army of up to 15 characters that can be individually recruited, equipped, class changed, ranked up, and equipped. A sort of backline-light system for party composition where the first row of characters define the active abilities and overall stats, and the backline characters add their attack power (in a way that’s not totally clear, to be fair). A hex-based world map where tiles can be explored and then improved to make islands produce more resources. A tech tree and a set of “industries” where materials can be improved in a production chain. Randomly generated quests. A method of controlling formation in the realtime battles (supposedly the game’s flagship feature), where the army ostensibly forms up into a line, a flying V, etc. This in theory gives passive bonuses and also changes the flagbearer’s special move. I also appreciate that the army can be manually directed with the thumbstick, but ultimately you can just turn on auto-movement and dial the speed up. I like that overall.

The most disappointing thing is that only the aggregate power of the army seems to make any difference. Not really the composition, or your tactics even. Formations degrade into clumped melees as soon as the army encounters enemies on the field. That being the case, the game is going to devolve into a grindfest to stockpile materials and currency used to level up soldiers, then rinse and repeat. I’m disappointed that I can already see the Matrix on this one, as all of the individual components add up to something that could be a hidden gem.
