Competent and polished space combat game. Leans into the arcade side of the genre instead of the sim side, and according to reviews is a looter-shooter at heart. Some neat elements like light puzzle solving by manipulating objects in the world. Has a neat trick where you fly into a docking station, make your changes, and fly back out again with no loading screen. However, since there is a loading screen between any two significant locations, the magic trick is ultimately pointless. I reflect on the different approaches between [[Starfield]] and [[No Man’s Sky]] with respect to loading screens. NMS really leans into its magic trick. I’ll forgive them the loading screen during fast travel, but the seamless flight between planet surface, space, docking at a station, etc. really is special. Starfield on the other hand makes the other and in my mind completely reasonable tradeoff and just says “instead of making you wait for thirty seconds of pulse drive travel to keep the illusion”, we’ll just give you a five-second loading screen. You lose the magic trick but gain some player convenience. There’s an argument for both. Everspace 2 really gets points for neither by straddling the line.

Ultimately I might have spent more time with this, I just don’t need another looter-shooter.
