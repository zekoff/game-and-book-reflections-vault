Most frequent loss condition is when you leave a tool behind the train’s progression path and can’t physically make it back to fetch the tool. Without the tool you can neither cut your way back to it, nor cut your way forward to the resources you might need to continue crafting tracks.

AI companion is shockingly good, making the game extremely playable solo. The companion will perform the action you give it with efficiency and will even do thoughtful things like stack resources ahead of you.

Good example of a realtime game that somehow doesn’t require twitch reflexes. One reason for that perhaps is that you perform the chop (wood or iron) action simply by having the right tool in your hand and walking up to the resource. No button spamming!
