This is probably the closest thing I’ve found to the PBBG experience I’d been searching for. It’s very janky. There are no concessions whatsoever to onboarding new players other than decent Wiki. The sort of game that you get out of it what you put into it, and which takes place in your head. This is accomplished through workmanlike graphics and UI as well as some natural and evocative descriptions and bits of flavor text. Death is not punished harshly and overall it seems to be a game where you can only ever trend towards more power as you continue to play. Action points refill at a reasonable rate where you can have a nice bite-sized experience of playing a couple of times a day.

I love the framing or narrative. The world has ended and now the forces of Good, Evil, and Free Will battle for dominance across multiple Planes of existence. One thing I think I’ll find special is the class advancement system. Mortals can take six different advanced classes depending on their morality, and each of those six has three more unique classes as exits, plus an additional class each for characters who have departed the morality of their originally chosen class. For example, all fallen paladin who has started as an angel but fallen to evil morality will actually have an additional class choice.
