A flawed gem. Slight emphasis on the “flawed.” Has the feeling of fanfic.

The writing is, occasionally, funny enough to elicit a chuckle. But it waffles between archaic faux-high language and then contemporary witticisms or anachronisms of phrase. The tone overall is Cute with a Capital C. The stakes are high as the characters relate them, but it doesn't feel demanding from the player's perspective. The protagonist, who is a 16-year-old girl, deals with what would normally be horrific events in stride and with a manic pixie dream girl style.  This reminds me so much of the fantasy forum and MUD-adjacent scene from when I was in middle school and early high school. I can’t pin down exactly what makes me say that. But I guarantee the writer hails from that era, or is steeped in some sort of tradition which passes through that era like an interstate.

The JRPG combat system is simple. There's nothing in it which hasn't been done before. And yet, it is engaging. This is an example of a template which works and does not require significant variation. Movement around the map is heavily tile-based. Each screen is hand authored and filled with quarks around which you must move. There is a crafting system in the game which feels straightforward. Equipment crafting is simply pumping your current chapters tier of equipment into your existing equipment. There is no buying new weapons and armor from shops. This is actually nice because it cuts down on one of the mundane inventory management tasks in classic JRPGs. The leveling curve is relatively smooth. I have done a bit of grinding along the way for the pleasure of watching the numbers go up. And I so far as a result have not hit a battle where I could not succeed. Some of them were nail buyers but none led to a game over. There is enough variation in the character builds that I do get a little of the feeling of breaking the game, which is nice. There's an understated class system in the game. Totally optional and easily miscible. And yet each character can transfigure into one of two different classes. The classes seem to be more flavor than utility but they are effective. It feels good to get a class up. There is a way to unset skill points but it does not appear that there is a way to change skill allocations. 

The cutesy fanfic story is the thing I struggle with the most. The character portraits are, and again I lean on this word, Cute. But not especially well done.

Overall, it is clear that this was a labor of intense love from the developers. They absolutely, smashingly succeeded in what I suppose must have been their goal. Which was to create a classic JRPG experience with light modernization and the feel of playing the Super Nintendo as a 13-year-old again.
