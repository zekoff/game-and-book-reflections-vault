Does a lot with a little, graphically. There are indeed only shapes and beats. Pulsing shapes and particle effects make things much more lively than they’d appear in screenshots. The soundtrack is a fine and occasionally compelling backdrop for the action but it misses something by not actually syncing with the action much as far as I can tell. The movement speed for the player’s avatar square is fairly slow but the game still feels twitchy and reaction based. This is a result of the short period between threat being signaled and threat being realized, coupled with the access to a dodge on a short cooldown that grants invulnerability. It’s made for frequent use and the game demands it.

This game didn’t cross over into to something special for me. It stayed at “neat”. I appreciate that I only played the demo version since I would have been fairly disappointed if paying full price.
