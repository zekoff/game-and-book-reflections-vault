Will be hard for this game to break out since it’s competing against dozens and dozens of rogue like card-battlers. A few clever ideas in it:

- Characters and cards are thinly veiled references to major game franchises. The first tutorial fight is against a legally distinct Charizard. There are references to other IntiCreates games as well as stand-ins for things like Castlevania. The intent is to create an atmosphere that celebrates games like Smash Brothers. Unfortunately, I don’t get all the references, and the overall art style is kind of garish. I really appreciate the approach though.
- Playing a card is accompanied by a fully voiced character line read in the voice of that character. The script is hammy but fun.
- There is a resource that can be spent to overcharge cards and destroy them in a huge burst of power. It takes them away for the remainder of the stage but could completely turn the tide of a single battle. A neat tweak not only because it has inherent risk/reward, but because it would be an alternate method of trimming your deck. Getting rid of cards turns out to be one of the most important things in these deck builders. This is a really fun way to provide that option.
- I think I like the tactical grid that characters move across as part of combat. It looks like [[MegaMan Battle Network]] but is turn based. That’s more my speed. That said, since every card can be played for its effect or discarded to move with it, it increases analysis paralysis and slows turns down.

It’s got one of those creepy relationships between the male protagonist and a busty naive female. Perhaps the charisma comes through and the relationship deepens later but I am too off-put to see that through.

Nonetheless, I don’t see anything special enough to separate this from the glut of other similar games.
