I didn't understand this game for a long time. (Arguably still don't fully understand.) But I finally achieved enough familiarity with it to progress at least to a point I can say I am conversant in its language.

I do love the flexibility of the class-less system and the incredible variety of nooks and crannies both through world design and systems design. One thing I don't like is that a well-accepted tactic is to find ways to cheese difficult enemies by finding quirks of their AI which prevent the player from being in danger.
