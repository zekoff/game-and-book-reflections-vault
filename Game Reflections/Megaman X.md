One of my top games of all time. Stands the test of time. I replayed it on my miniature throwback SNES console and it was just as good as I remember.

Hadouken secret weapon. Zero's theme. The feel of picking up his arm cannon for the first time. Boss ordering to make their stages or fights easier. Powered-up versions of sub-weapon. The wall-jump without which all other Megaman games are unplayable.
