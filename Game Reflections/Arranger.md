Makes an excellent first impression. In handheld mode, the UI is scaled just right. The beautiful art brings you immediately into the world. It’s watercolor with deformed cartoon characters -- enlarged versions of the characters which fit on square tiles. There’s a wordless introduction level that serves as both a tutorial and a story prologue. A mother places a child in a basket before giant stone doors after navigating the level. The mother flees an unseen threat. Control switches back to the child in the basket. The child cannot move. Pressing buttons just wiggles the child impotently on a tile. Purple jagged sprites start encroaching from the edges of the level. They accelerate in growth and surround the child as I experienced a moment of panic and then the screen fades to black. Movement is also very snappy. That’s absolutely critical for this game, where movement is the only way of affecting the world and solving puzzles. I can’t say it’s the only way of interacting with the world, since there is a button to speak with characters as well.

I read in a review that this game is 5-8 hours. Comparatively bite-sized against the potentially infinite time I could invest into [[Darkest Dungeon]]. There was a natural breakpoint after a failed Darkest Dungeon run that prompted me to switch over.

Reminds me of the way [[Portal]] felt in two ways. There is the direct mechanical correlation of how the wrapping tiles connect locations in non-2D or non-Euclidian ways. There is also the potential for “ah-ha” moments using nothing but progressive levels that point you to new ways of thinking without ever giving you a new core ability. 

It's in contrast to Metroidvanias in that way. Metroidvanias give you new abilities that recontextualize the same level. Arranger gives you new levels that recontextualize the same ability.

Completed the story in a few hours. Skipped all optional puzzles. It barely kept me hanging on mechanically. There was variation and a nice page to the iteration of puzzle challenges, but the dialogue and characters were exhausting. The writing is preachy and intensely informed by the culture of the moment. I almost dreaded each new segment since I knew it would come with more characters and dialogue. I'll grant that I laughed a couple of times when a joke landed.

I'm not sure why it was billed as a role playing adventure. It was ultimately just a marketing stunt to call it this. It's a puzzle game with dialogue.
