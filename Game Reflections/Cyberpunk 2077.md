I returned to this game after the release of Phantom Liberty and patch 2.1, wanting to see how far it had come since I played it upon release. Certainly the level of polish has increased, and the changes in the skill system are immediately obvious. Here’s a case where the game was already at 80% of its final form upon release, but those last 20% made ten times the difference. However… I am saying this a lot this year, but I don’t know if I can continue to stomach the world. It’s all-in on its setting. 100% Cyber, 100% Punk. But instead of maturity, it has opted for “adult”. Instead of [[The Lord of the Rings]], it’s [[Game of Thrones series|Game of Thrones]]. I think this may be the CDPR house style. [[The Witcher]] is [[Final Fantasy series|Final Fantasy]] through the lens of CPDR. Cyberpunk 2077 is that style.

Here’s a game that feels like a full-on RPG in first-person, yet without the jank of a [[System Shock (Remake)|System Shock]].
