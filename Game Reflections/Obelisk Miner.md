I hate this game intensely and can’t quit. I anger-uninstalled it one night only to re-install it the next morning and be distressed that it had backed out some of my progress.

This is the sort of game I’m about to find that I hate when I analyze the last couple of years. It has no decisions to be made. It simply dries up its dopamine hits slowly and gently so that you open up your wallet to get the hits flowing again. The most insidious and close to evil sort of game that we can make. Did I have fun? No. Do I regret giving up two days and about $40 to it? Sort of. It was a small price to pay for wisdom. But psychologically costly.

With apologies to Screwtape: this is a game which takes from you and gives nothing in return.
