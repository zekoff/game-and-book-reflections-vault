Colorful and friendly and yet Kirby is oddly heroic. Stages are fun to explore. They each contain little cute secrets. Typically I’ll find half of the secrets on my first trip which is actually a nice balance. I feel smart but the stages aren’t trivial. The difficulty is trivial but it’s so fun to watch things happen. Enemies bounce around and animate cutely. Grass sways as Kirby inhales. Mouthful modes are surprising and funny and span the spectrum from one-note jokes to legitimate mechanical detours.

One oddity that sticks out to me are the Woofies. Extremely cute fox animals that seem to be a primary antagonist. I still feel bad attacking Woofies.
