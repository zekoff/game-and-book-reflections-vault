Somehow straddles the perfect line between crunchy engine-building and approachable family game. The table presence is a huge part of its appeal. One of my favorite details is how the berry resources are actually a little squishy. It’s not actually the thematics that work for me -- the forest animal… city building… thing, is kind of shrug. But the components are so delightful that it actually makes the theme come alive for me. In the first game I knocked on the table to imply hammering while building a Construction. Jack loved it and was a moment that really brought the theme home to everyone else.

The rulebook make the game seem more complex than it is. And, certainly, there are some edge cases. But this is a game where the cards make things much, much more palatable. The “just in time” rules mean that a less-experienced player can simply read what a thing does, instead of ingesting the rulebook.
