The BioShock arm of the franchise is teetering right on the border of not being an immersive sim at all. Instead it is almost just an action game. "Shoot" is really the only meaningful verb in the game. There's hacking too but it's for puzzles and as a combat assist.

"Will the Circle Be Unbroken" will be forever colored by this game for me. The beautiful introductory sequence of blasting off from the lighthouse. I'll also never forget the respawn animation of Elizabeth pulling you up from the ground.

"There's always a man. There's always a lighthouse." Memorable phrase, although I'm still not sure whether I love it or hate it.
