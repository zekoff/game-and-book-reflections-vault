I definitely liked this game, but it may have been a victim of its own hype. It’s compulsive, more than it is necessarily brilliant. There’s an “everything game” element to it. Procedurally-generated exploration area, collect-em-all fish cards with rarity, gear collecting and upgrading, restaurant management sim, farming area… And some story-driven content. There are also a couple of elements of it which would “add on a point” for other people, but which don’t help me. First, I don’t care about sushi. Apparently a lot of people do -- there sure are a lot of sushi-themed games, and people sure do like eating sushi in real life. But since that doesn’t matter to me, much of the thematic dressing carries no flavor. Second, I suspect that the Switch port is less than excellent, and adds tiny bits of friction here and there which all add up over time. There’s long loading between areas, an almost-imperceptible amount of input lag, and occasional dropped button presses. These end up making a difference. I’ve also seen the writing lauded as one of the game’s selling points, but it hasn’t captured me so far. Some good things: the animations for events like upgrading a dish or crafting a new weapon are amazing. Over-the-top characterization which is delightful. The upgrade loop is certainly captivating, and is the primary thing that’s kept me playing past the point where I really think I should have been done with the game.
