Tied for first with [[Super Mario RPG]] and [[Final Fantasy VI]] as the best JRPG for the Super Nintendo. I played the opening many times for whatever reason. To this day I've only played the game via emulation. The Tech system is particularly memorable (Dual and Triple Techs). Outstanding music and character design.

I came across a Youtube video recently identifying some of the key elements of CT spritework. The deconstruction was interesting for its own sake but it was something else that struck me. When the entire cast was laid out side by side I could name every single one of them despite not having played the game in a decade (or two?).
