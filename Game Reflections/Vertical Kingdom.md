The game’s central conceit is underutilized. There’s no obvious reason why towns can only be built vertically. There’s one line, perhaps only in the tutorial, that says “we’re running out of space so must build upwards.” For a game that turns out to have a surprising amount of text-filled pages, this concept should have been expanded on early. The title-based theme does nothing more than indicate why there are certain constraints on building.

The visual appeal of the towns is minimal. Residential buildings do morph as they’re attached. It’s a minimal nod to the feeling of actually constructing towers. There is little other aesthetic indication of building a town. The resulting feel is tile-laying rather than city construction. Being able to flip asymmetric buildings would have made a big difference both aesthetically and a slight improvement mechanically.

The outer loop of the game is a Spire-like movement through a branching map of nodes. Some (weirdly small?) nodes are the city building stages. Other nodes are simple events. There is some power accretion as the run goes on through collection of artifacts. Artifact power ranged from minimal to significant. A comparison point might be the strategic map of [[Against the Storm]]. Previous towns contribute to future towns. There is more focus on the artifacts to give variation in VK, where AtS promoted variation through city-specific randomized building availability.

The deck-building element of the city builds was unique. Set collection (e.g. three small brick houses can combine to a… brick tower? nonetheless) promoted hand management decisions. It was a little too much randomness for a true city builder. It is another decision that pushes the game more towards a tabletop tile-laying Eurogame than a traditional digital city-building game. One decision point that did work effectively was when the game stops every few hands and requires a commitment to the balance in overall card types that will be drawn over the next few turns. Your city might need a Merchant building which is part of the “Special” category. You’d add “Special” to your next deck alongside perhaps “Residential” and “Farming”. You know you’re only fishing for one special card which means the rest will be garbage. It might prompt you to suffer intentionally for a few hands, or it might prompt you to unlock an additional special card purchase for variation, or it might prompt you to simply hold off as long as you can and focus on other elements. I can’t think of a time I’ve seen this approach before. It would be difficult to do in a physical deck-builder and is one of the places that digital is leveraged here for more than just accounting purposes.

The metaprogression system was stingy. A successful run unlocked one marginal power enhancement. Each power enhancement node is also locked behind a mandatory cosmetic improvement purchase for the “throne room”.
