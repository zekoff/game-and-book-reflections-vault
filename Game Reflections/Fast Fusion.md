Fun racing game -- probably in the lineage of [[F-Zero]], although I haven’t played much of that series. Something different from Karting games or from simulation racers. Muddy, forgettable textures, and limited cohesion in overall aesthetic, but shines through based on its mechanics. Racing machines can freely jump and have access to a limited boost. The boost can spin out opponents or can be used for more expected uses like shaving time off curves. The jump feature allows for high-risk swaps to short alternate routes on most courses. I really appreciate that a full three-course circuit takes less than 15 minutes.

This was my first Switch 2 exclusive, purchased because it was cheap and hailed as an early cult favorite.
