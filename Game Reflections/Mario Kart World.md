It is Mario Kart. The ability to boost in-place on straightaways is neat and the wall-riding is also a fun addition. I can see it opening up different approaches to courses when and if I become skilled. That sort of recontextualization is such a powerful element of games. It shares that DNA with, take a drink, Metroidvanias. The moment when you understand the way an ability interacts with the stage in a new way and it recontextualizes things. The free roaming in the open world is not nearly as interesting as I thought it would be. Knockout mode is a neat use of the open world. I understand now when the free roam isn’t headlined like I thought it would be.
