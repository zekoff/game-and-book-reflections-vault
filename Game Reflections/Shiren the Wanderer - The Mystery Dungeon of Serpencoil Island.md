Didn't overly tutorialize. Made me go find the in game manual.

Passive healing is very fast. Simply moving between rooms is occasionally enough to heal you back to full after combat. Healing is much faster than in most other traditional roguelikes.

Not a game of attrition. Game can end very swiftly if a single combat goes poorly. Inventory limit is tight, which encourages you to use your items.

I haven’t reached a point where starvation was at all a threat. Maybe that indicates I should be spending more time grinding on each floor instead of progressing.

I had read about this series and one of its unique features being how monsters can level up. Certainly I had one experience where a monster leveled up and became especially deadly. I had to dig into my bag of tricks to beat that single monster which effectively was a boss fight. Ended up winning by afflicting him with a wand which caused him to take any damage he dealt to me (Empathy Staff?). I would paralyze him with another staff, heal myself with a Rejuvenation Pot, afflict him with Empathy (which would cause the paralysis to wear off), trade blows for a couple or three until I was one hit from death, then repeat.

This game should be something I treasure -- a full-priced, fully-polished, traditional roguelike on the Switch. And so far, I really am getting a good experience from it.

Fills out an in game notebook of enemies, items, effects, etc. as you encounter them. I love this. Something I praise [[DCSS|Dungeon Crawl - Stone Soup]] for. Makes me willing to experience things new and not go to a wiki.
