Incredible optimization problem that mandates teamwork. Optimization of numbers, timing, and coordination. I’m in a game with experienced players who are playing at a competitive level. That’s given me insight into the highest levels of gameplay that I’d never otherwise have had. They’ve also been kind to coach me as I get started.

The high level play is about exporting state information from the game UI, plugging it into an external tool to calculate offensive and defensive strengths, and then launching attacks. Info gathering is a key part of target selection. Once viable targets are selected, the decision process seems to be some combination of which targets are becoming strategic threats, analysis of the target’s race and associated units, and a little bit of guesswork about whether the target will “stack draftees” or “pump walls” which can provide a small boost to defensive power. One of the features that seems interesting is that combat resolution is binary. If the attacker has more offensive power than the defender’s defensive power, the attacker will win. It shifts the game to one of careful analysis and projection hours into the future.

This highlights how seemingly small decisions have massive impacts on player experience. Deterministic combat is a very standard decision in the trade space of combat resolution. But now it shifts the focus to careful calculation instead of a more gut-feel approach.

Thresholds of dominion size affect invasion returns. Attacking a dominion of 75% your size or less dramatically reduces the return you get. This means the opportunity cost is the primary reason you would choose targets differently -- your troops are gone for a while after hitting that low-value target. This effectively protects from bottom-feeding. The potential for bullying still exists but players playing in good faith would not target dominions who are not current threats.

The ability for supporting dominions to provide espionage and magic assistance means there’s a place for players who don’t want to focus on military. Team coordination is important.

Another singular property of this game is that very small percentage increases to things have a disproportionately large impact. Being just a fraction of a percentage behind in certain areas means you’ll become a target and suffer potentially large percentage impacts (15% of your total dominion at once potentially). Days into the game the Offensive and Defensive power levels for top-level dominions are on the order of 10,000. Those top-level players were actively discussing how deltas of 92 DP would mean the difference between being able to launch certain attacks at certain times.

Automation gameplay exists to a limited degree. Three times per day you can automate a small subset of available actions. For someone like me it means I can automate some overnight turns and give myself a few more knobs to turn during the next day (12 hours from the automated turns). For some players it seems to mean literally the difference between when they can sleep.

About two weeks in, this game fits the cadence I was looking for in a PBBG. Overall I don’t think it’s the game I’m looking for though. I’d prefer something with more expressive play. The ability to build a dominion based on how I want it to be rather than what’s optimal. I don’t feel that freedom here. Missteps mean my toys will be taken away, and suboptimal play means I am hurting my realm-mates.

Study in game theory. Being able to defend against the strongest is an important consideration. Perfect information changes the dynamic. There is espionage but it's binary success. No opportunity for misdirection or obfuscation. 

Completed the full 47-day round. I’m relieved it's over even though I am thrilled I had the opportunity to play the game. The developer conducted a survey during the round. One of the questions was “what’s the most frustrating thing about the game?” My answer was something like the following:

Success in the game requires three things: 1) deep understanding of the rules, mechanics, and even metagame, 2) close coordination and constant communication with your realmmates, and 3) willingness to build your real life schedule around OpenDominion at nearly any cost. #1 and #2 are fine from my perspective. #3 will prevent me from continuing to play.

I ended up with a very competitive realm thanks to randomly getting placed with that “pack” of five expert players plus a sixth expert player by chance. Watching them continued to be instructive throughout the 47 days. It was clear that they deeply understood the metagame. They considered elements of player psychology as part of their strategy. Trying to judge the likely moves of other top competitors. They also had rich discussions about optimal plays and expressed uncertainty at times leading me to believe the game is by no means “solved”.

I had essentially one clever play of my own during the 47 day round. I found myself stuck in a vicious cycle where I ended up having to spend most of my resources each tick to keep building defenses. Each tick I’d have less and less left over to build my economy. Down the spiral went until I was pumping everything into defenses and still falling behind. I realized I could tear down and rebuild one type of long-term economic building into a defense-boosting building. I floated the idea past my expert-level realmmates and they responded, essentially, “actually that could work.” This dramatically changed the math of my economy and was the turning point in the round for me. I ended in the top third of the dominions for the round.

That being said, even though I was easily in the top third of the game and possibly in the top quarter, the best players were about 35% bigger than me and the top two or three players were about 65% bigger than me. I was ultimately irrelevant to my realm because I didn’t bring anything special to the table. Had I not been there and been replaced with someone average instead of my above-average, it would have had perhaps had about 1.5% difference on the final score of the realm.

I take that back -- I did have value as an integrated part in the overall ops campaigns of the realm. I was the difference at times between a successful realm op and an unsuccessful one. An example that comes to mind was a “snare campaign” we conducted at one point. Between six of us pooling our spy strength and hitting one target, we were able to prevent that person from re-casting a critical defensive spell, and we opened up a hit for our “runner” who attacked constantly for our realm. The runner kept pressure on other dominions in the style of an arms race. Everyone knew they had to defend against him that prevented others from maximizing their own offense. Had I not been an integrated part of the team those sorts of ops campaigns would not have worked. In that way my land contribution was an extra 1.5% but my total team contribution was actually much greater. Upon reflection that is a very special element of the game. And those moments did grant a singular type of fiero experience that I’ve not often had in games.

One of the reasons I wouldn’t play again is natural loss aversion. Building a dominion up acre by acre through executing a spreadsheet feels… fine, I guess. Losing a couple of hundred acres because of a small lapse in attention feels awful. The game is not about making clever moves, it’s about not making mistakes.

Near the end more than one player in my realm remarked upon how excited they were to being able to sleep more than 6 hours after the round concluded. I might have been toying with another round until those comments.

I happened to be reading [[Empires of EVE - Volume 2]] as the round wrapped up. I was struck by some similarities. Competitive play for a realm hinges inordinately upon the top players and their agendas. Grudges and history between players is a factor. Time zones and ability to hop online based around on and off hours is important. The game is complex enough that metagame counters are continually evolving. Most strikingly the expectation that real life will serve the whim of the teamplay coordination.

Incredibly memorable experience.
