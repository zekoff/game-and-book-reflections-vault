I’m grateful this was a demo. If I hadn’t been budget-conscious (and there’d been no demo) I would likely have taken a chance and bought it. This game isn’t for me and the demo saved me from wasting $20. The demo is an act of both courtesy for players and an act of effective marketing. The courtesy is that people like me don’t feel we’ve wasted money. The marketing is that most people probably don’t enjoy the flexibility that I do to purchase many games per year. Getting to play the demo for free sets the barrier of entry at zero. The game then gets a chance to set the hook and send you back to the eShop to purchase. A developer still gets to make their single-purchase product but you get the low entry barrier of a mobile free-to-play game. 

The game isn’t technologically optimized for Switch handheld play. The resolution appears to be stuffed down to 720p from 1080p meaning blurry and small fonts and other UI elements. For this reason alone, I hope that Switch 2 has 1080p in handheld. Even 1080p is aging but I’ve never run into a game yet that doesn’t at least provide baseline support for it. I also encountered terrain clipping problems during movement. The framerate didn’t appear to be 60fps (though my eyes are not well-trained to notice it) and I wonder if there is collision checking that expects higher framerates and thus smaller physics steps.

In the first ten minutes of the game I noticed the audible clicking of the thumbsticks as I threw them back and forth. This was the exact moment I knew the game wouldn’t be a purchase. By the end of my ~25 minutes with it my hands were already hurting.

The autoaim is incredibly generous. And why not? This is a single player game and it’s very clearly about feeling like a badass. That generous autoaim made a good first gameplay impression. The chainsaw leg appears to be the signature move and is useful as an attack and a mobility option -- always good to have dual-use abilities. There’s a dash and a double jump too although the double jump feels anemic. Movement speed is very, very fast. Enemies deal enough damage that they are threats, but your tools can also make short work of them.

I hated the game’s aesthetic. Cyberpunk gorefest with angry cursing and unneeded narration.

As far as I can tell, the game certainly achieves what it sets out to do -- to be the best [[Quake]] it can be in the 2020s.
