A series about collecting monsters and breaking the game. Each monster has a particular trait. The trait is unique across all monsters. Building a party is about a lot of things, but mostly about finding a combination of six traits that break the game.

The game also includes fusion of monsters, equipment, more spells that I can count, a five-node rock/paper/scissors system, crafting, dozens of different progression systems. Any individual level is hypnotic. The real game is in the outer loop of crafting the ultimate party to take into battle.

Each monster of the hundreds of different types has custom artwork.
