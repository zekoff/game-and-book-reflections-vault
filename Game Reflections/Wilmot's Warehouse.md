Game does a lot with a little -- at the end of the day, 95% of the art is squares with either static icons or some squares with cute but inconsequential animation on their face. It is satisfying to organize the items in your warehouse. For a certain type of person this would be catnip. Much as [[Factorio]] holds a deep and precise appeal to an engineer brain, this would likely hold a deep and precise appeal to another type of thinker.

The controls to grab boxes are ever-so-slightly unreliable. This is a significant miss for a game that is literally about nothing but moving boxes. I’m never sure what box I will grab when I tap the A button unless there is only one box adjacent to me. Same for B -- I’m never sure what the logic is for dropping a certain box with a single button press. I also don’t fully understand why the game seems to require various amounts of time holding the A button down before it engages the precision select mode. Although this friction in the core (only?) mechanic of the game should wreck it, it’s merely an annoyance. I think this is because the game is still happening a lot in your brain. You are mentally cataloguing your items and path around with them while you manipulate them.
