As in [[BioShock]] the environmental design is unsubtle. Things are a little larger than life -- the pipe default weapon is gigantic in the hands. Also something about the use of color and texture I have never put my finger on. Lots of shiny textures versus matte. Lots of contrast between lights and dark. 

The controls and UI are abominable. The button mappings are unintuitive and the look speed is too fast for the precise manipulation needed to point at objects in the world. The signature 3D-look-to-2D-interface works poorly on a control pad. Mouse would be better and so the game needs at least a little pass on that part. Yet in 2025 I’d expect more work done to make the console control scheme more native. No option to scale the interface, inconsistent behavior of buttons from one place to another. When reading a message, right stick did nothing. When on menu of messages, right stick scrolls until it doesn't.

Appreciate things flagged as junk but just don't make them interactive. I don’t want to pick them up at all since they have no use.

Weird intro that I don’t remember from the remastered original.

Odd tutorial. It’s tutorizaled that I should press X to pick something up, but not cyberspace movement and objectives is not tutorialized. Neither are puzzles tutorialized although I found a second puzzle later very different from the first. I apppreciate that a LOT more, hoping that each puzzle would be unique like that. I’d rather have had no tutorial at all. Let me enjoy being bewildered and discovering things. Maybe just give me a control mapping and then back away.

I am shocked at how unthreatening the zombies are. Zombies in [[System Shock 2]] are a threat for a long time, maybe most or all of the game. Here you can simplys stunlock them and beat them to death at no risk using the starter weapon.

Cyberspace reminds me of [[Descent]], a 3D FPS from this era. It’s difficult to navigate in free 3D space with no constraints and no guide markers. Cyberspace is so abstract that you literally can’t tell up from down. Descent had (in my memory at least) tells in the environment reminding you which way is up. A map too, I think. Cyberspace has none of that.

I just don't believe in this game right out of the gate. Why? Why do I know it will disrespect me?

What? Random physics enabled hospital bed when geometry had been completely static to not?

Pacing issues with weapons but this could be true of the original.

If I were going to play system shock I am not sure if I'd play this or the remastered version.

Why is there an aim button? Just because it's 2025? Left trigger is one of the most prominent buttons on the controller. Aim is a functionally useless button in this game. Is there no better use to which it could have been put? A shift button to allow more things mapped to face buttons?

I blundered into a turret, got shot, calmly turned to find where it was, then waited away. Tense. Never been at risk of dying 

Doesn't feel like a place. Just ask samey corridor 

I did finally just have my first experience of being threatened. I walked into a room with a gun shooting zombie. The room was also full of radiation while I was in looking around another zombie came up behind me. Then when leaving hey I walked into the field of view of a turret. Then when walking back to the surgical day, another random respond. Zombie came walking up at no point was I ever truly concerned about dying, but I did did occur to me that I would have to manage my health on the way back to the healing table

I spent about 60 seconds poking around in a room full of radiation while my character audibly gasped and by the time I left I had lost two out of my 24 health pips. I am astonished at how unthreatening this game is

Early on I solved the untutorialized puzzle and while poking around in the area it unlocked I found a gun that shoots electricity. The gun drains from your personal energy reserves. You can fill up those personal energy reserves at power pylons that continually regenerate in multiple places. So I just went through the first part of the game with infinite ammo

I recall the [[Resident Evil]] model of weapon management being used. The minimum weapon you can get away with to kill enemies without taking enough damage to overly consume your health resources here. I'm just blasting away because I don't want to waste time swinging my wrench over and over standing in the same place

I'm comparing this to the wizardry proving grounds of the mad overlord remake. The digital extremes did recently. That game was completely redone and yet exactly wizardry as those who played it experienced it. This game is the worst of both worlds. It has none of the menace and dispassion the casual cruelty of the original and yet it has none of the magic of Discovery or novelty. All of its new systems are poorly implemented. Versions of things close to perfected in 2025

So there is also stuff that is not marked as jump. It's junk that you can pick up off of enemies. Sometimes an enemy will have an inventory filled with a mix of junk and not junk. There is a hot key to take everything at one time. There is no easy way to select single things that you want. You must move the cursor slowly over to the thing you want. Press a to pick it up. Move it slowly over to a place open slot in your inventory and press a to put it down. Inexplicably if you press X while you're inventory is open, it will auto sort everything including Auto sorted, everything you had equipped in your hot bar meaning replacing things that you had previously set up your hot bar with

I finally died thanks to not knowing the hotkey for healing items. Fabulously atmospheric ending Sting featuring shodan. Which reminded me that she's had one voice line so far, reading out the ten floors of citadel station with the menace of a bored tour guide

Died due to utter lack of consequence when I respond hold on after I died. The ending stinger showing showdown repossessing you for a cyborg body. Had to be prefaced by a loading screen. Not good but then you continue. We press continue and are resurrected at the med Bay which I believe is supposed to be diegetic in the world because it's a cloning Bay. Maybe that's only in system shock too. And so then I ran right back to where I died with no respond enemies in the way. Walk down the elevator and with my infinite ammo pistol took a total of four shots to clear the room

The interface still has numbers 1 through 0 on the hotkey bar as if it were for a keyboard

I just hit a switch panel puzzle that was legitimately cool. I walked up with no idea what would happen and there was new tutorial so I started messing around with it. I couldn't figure out what to do at first and then I realized oh I'm not supposed to know what to do. I need to fiddle with these switches and dials and plugs to understand how this machine is supposed to operate now. I still can't tell if I successfully did it or not but that was my first moment of cool in this game

It's lazy gross just piles of rendered human viscera on the floor in random places. It looks both plastic and disgusting compared to something like Doom’ relentless and brutal commitment to disgusting over-the-top imagery which ends up feeling metal instead of gory.

That was the lamest grenade I've ever thrown. I walked into a room with two zombies. Had plenty of grenades to spare and thought I'd try the gas grenade out of my inventory. I lobbed it perfectly between them. It exploded and did nothing to either of them. They both simply turned walked towards me and I killed them with conventional weapons

This game is truly awful compared to how long it's spent in development, how much fanfare the development, the developer put around it and how critically acclaimed it has been on release.

This is a case of expectations not matching reality. If this had been a initial effort from a solo or small developer, it would be impressive. I'd be willing to give it a little more. Grace, but mostly I would be less disappointed in it when I gave up. Because of the pedigree of this game and vigorous self-interpretation of its developer, my reaction has become extremely negative

I remember an update for Kickstarter backers that came out probably multiple years after the campaign concluded. The CEO of the studio announced that he had made the decision to move the game from unity to unreal. He did a bizarre performative job of falling on a sword he crafted for himself saying he took full responsibility and he could withstand all the arrows thrown at him. In the service of making this the best game it could play at that time in the industry. Unity could have been used just as well as unreal for the game. This was projected to be in the late 2010s. I remember at that moment realizing the game was screwed. I was incorrect in my prediction that it would never release. However I wish I had been right. Having played what did release

It's a lot of fun to write about things you have strong emotions about. Typically for me I try to focus on the things I really like. This is a case where I'm really enjoying talking about something that I have strong negative emotions about
