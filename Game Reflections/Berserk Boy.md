I can’t help but think of the [[Metal Slug]] franchise because of the dimensions of the sprites. Fairly large compared to the size of the screen, and super-deformed in the sense of large heads on otherwise standard video-game-sprite bodies.

I can’t believe what a hipster I am saying this, but the font is off-putting in this game. It’s like… bad Arial. Pixelated, almost-smooth.

The gameplay is perfectly fine. It’s an alternate-universe version of [[MegaMan]]. The IntiCreates [[Gunvolt]] games are what you get when you start with MegaMan and riff on it. This game is the opposite -- it’s like what you’d get if you started with Gunvolt and riffed on it towards MegaMan. The initial power, which is maybe just called “Berserk” power (?) is far away the more interesting of the two I’ve unlocked so far, but to be fair that’s coming from someone who adores the Copen mechanics of the recent [[Azure Striker]] sub-sub-franchise, where you dash into enemies to combo and to set up your offensive. The Fire power gives you the ability to drill into certain surfaces. Interestingly, the control for these drilling sections is the same as the [[Pepper Grinder]] game. Pepper Grinder is that whole mechanic inflated to a game.

  

I kept going back to this game over a few weeks to see if it clicked. I’d knock out one checkpoint at a time, be underwhelmed, and move to something else. Then I remapped the controls to something more like [[Megaman X]]. (Bafflingly, the default control scheme maps the controls to buttons I’ve never before encountered in a platformer, to the best of my memory.) I did this a little after the time I got the second power set. About this time, the game started using different powers than I was used to. No more combo attack for the fire power; instead, an uppercut that took a long time to execute and for practical purposes neutered the fire power’s big thing which was a three hit upgradeable combo. I bounced into and out of the game a couple more times before it hit me: perhaps the control remapping had bugged the controls and locked me out of certain moves. I tried to remap the controls when I thought of it, but couldn’t access the options. I traversed back to the last checkpoint and saved. I backed out of the game entirely to the title screen. I remapped back to default, jumped back in, and sure enough the full suite of moves was accessible. This was very nearly the end for me. I moved forward and had to re-fight a miniboss I’d already beaten. Then I kept going and couldn’t get back to grips with the crazy default controls. Uninstalled. Just too much nonsense.
