The game that truly revitalized the slow-life farming game. I recall the farming being addictive. I didn't so much like the relationship system, but then I rarely do in any game. The only thing that's kept me from returning to it more often is that I don't care to dive into the mines and play the basic top-down combat ([[The Legend of Zelda - A Link to the Past|LttP]]-style) that's required to get ore.
