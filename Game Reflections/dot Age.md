True worker-placement game. The city building is effective because it’s significantly influenced by opportunity costs and adjacency bonuses. The food and childbirth system is straight from [[Agricola]]. I actually appreciate that the Pip food consumption is simply one per turn as opposed to Agricola’s unnecessarily complicated system of two food per turn except for children which give one food per turn. Here’s an area where, counterintuitively, the digital version of a system is cleaner than the tabletop version. It’s a trust-building feature -- the design tends toward game instead of simulation.

Several more hours in and the game continues to hold up. My understanding of the systems builds and I’m rewarded for that growing understanding. The life of the village may perhaps be too long. I am on track to have maybe a 12-15 hour play if I win. If I lose and I’m 10 hours in… well, I don’t know that I care too much for that. I’ll certainly start over wiser. But that’s a lot of time to give up. On balance I’m still playing for the joy of the game though and not for unlocks.

That’s actually a nice trick the game is pulling. I was compelled to continue playing even before the unlock system was unlocked (sigh). A counterpoint to my recent experience with [[Thronefall]] where the game ended when the unlock drip dried up.
