Click to instantly advance title cards. Amazing music. Creative level design. Smooth platforming. Charismatic lead and dialogue that brings wholesome smiles. Faux 2D. Joy of collectibles. Clean, confident character designs with big strokes and solid colors. Will age well. Reminds me of a Gameboy Advance generation of games and I can't put my finger on why. Each move in both characters moveset is good enough to be a defining mechanic in another game. Pace is not relentless but still broadly in the category of twitch skill. Harder and harder for me. I HATE time trials but sought them out here. Incredible craftsmanship over all. This is a video game ladies and gentlemen.

Surprising at first that the excellent titular grapple was limited to certain locations. Its so good that it could be used everywhere. This choice does force the use of varies tools in the toolkit however. It also makes it fun and obvious when the grapple is required. It actually reduces the amount of creativity required during the time trials and makes them more approachable. 

First time in my life I've ever gone to the credits on purpose. Two people did everything? Except for the music which was 3 other people. Made in Game Maker? Stunning.

I hate that the physical demands of this light-duty game are now a factor for me. The game that most maximized enjoyment, playtime, and minimal input is [[Into the Breach]]. I might go so far as to say most of my playtime with that game was not making inputs via controller. It was staring at the screen thoughtfully.

Different special powers per character per world. 

Realize I no longer want my dexterity tested. This game is still fun but I can see the arc where it is growing in the what it demands. I am fine with planning and maybe reacting to telegraphed threats. [[Thronefall]] works like this. Zelda works like this.
