Hex based small party tactics. Cited as offering tremendous viable option in party builds. I have only played a couple of missions so far. Like many PC first games, it feels crammed onto the Switch from a technical perspective, but it seems to ultimately work. Key art is generic but pretty. Saturated colors, some nods toward polygons, and clean textures. Load times are on the long side. Onscreen cursor move speed is slow. Extremely small font in handheld mode. Actually unreadable for some elements. This is why I'll end up not playing much. Other than load times, performance is fine. Seems solid but I completed the first mission (30 minutes?) without a level up, so I'll never experience the marquee feature which supposedly is the character advancement and build system. Does one neat trick where you directly control character movement between battles to trigger things on the map. And when you move to a new battlefield, a new set of tiles pops up from beneath the world and you can move right into it.
