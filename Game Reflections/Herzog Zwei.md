Before its time given that it was released in 1989. [[Dune 2]] was released in 1992.

The control approach is sneakily effective given the constraints of a console and especially the constraints of controllers in that generation of consoles. The player directly controls a transforming jet/robot. That alone is neat although the game is quite difficult to get any kind of actions per minute going like it really demands. I had to rely on occasional cheesing of the enemy units to counter their superior ability to build units and manage their economy.

Having only indirect control over deployed units but relying on them for heavy lifting is an approach that didn't stick in the genre but has its merits. There's a stronger sense of identity as the player controls only their unit. There's also more agency in a way because you do get direct control over something. In contrast to the way RTS ended up, where you give orders to your units but don’t directly control them. In a way that’s almost the worst of both words. Units don’t really act on their own other than to attack things nearby, but there’s also no real satisfaction of intimate control. It requires micromanagement and yet there’s a layer of abstraction to it. The fact that the camera is tied to your player unit also more naturally surfaces attention as a resource because your screen is only ever on your agent. The minimap may be telling you to go elsewhere but your attention isn't really split in the way it is for the Dune tree of RTS.

This was a nice case study as a road-not-taken for the genre. There are things here worth resurrecting.
