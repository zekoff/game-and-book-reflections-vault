I loved this game. Every civ/nation/whatever was so different in the way they played. Completely different units, different affinities for tiles, different magic spells. The magic spells were often wild. The ability to move units between different planes stands out. I loved this game so much that I bought a custom-printed physical copy of the multi-hundred page codex instruction manual reference document.
