Went back and played a few minutes to remind myself of why I was so impressed with this game. (I was surprised this game wasn’t already in my log. However, I suppose I started this fairly late in 2023. I actually haven’t been keeping these reflections as long as it seemed.)

A few key elements that make this unique and compulsive:

- The game takes place on a large top-down map which is gradually revealed as your minions explore. Pushing back a fog of war is almost always satisfying on its own in any game. Part of the fun here is also seeing what you’ll reveal. There are small caches of resources, monster lairs which you can generally sense directionally since monsters will come from that direction of the fog, and then larger structures that change map dynamics.
- Building the different minions is a fun process. You have a loot chest full of heads, bodies, legs, and arms. Each one comes with particular stats. Some are standard -- health, speed. Some are unique -- armor, mana regen. This system is a little more complex than necessary. I rarely optimize around, say, one leg of one type and one of the other. That said, I do often select two different arm types. The arms are particularly interesting as they define what weapons the minion will use.
- Minions are reasonably competent on their own. They’ll explore the map and engage in combat with basic AI like kiting enemies to use ranged attacks. Each one can also be manually controlled. This direct control adds a big sense of agency and sidesteps the helpless feeling that can accompany games without direct control of units. The direct control is a tradeoff because it adds an “attention as a resource” dynamic. There is a small gap orders since you can either let units explore automatically or control them directly, but you can’t send them in a specific direction. Sometimes they’ll clump up. This probably makes them more effective in fighting but means you’ll explore less of the map.
- The direct control mode is cloest to a “survivors-like” where your unit attacks automatically against large waves of weak enemies. Your only control is movement. The fun comes in avoiding enemy attacks while keeping them in range of your own. The weakness here compared to VS is that attacks are basic auto-targeting direct fire moves. No strange patterns to work around like the birds in VS.
- Each individually unit is pretty fragile. You can’t expect them to last too long. However, the increasing power of parts that you loot means they’ll be tougher. That’s matched with increasing enemy difficulty so it ends up being something of a wash.
- There’s an in-stage loop of powering up your tower with resources. There’s also a meta loop of gathering persistent resources to grow your power across your save file.
- Certain combinations of parts yield a named minion type which is saved to a library for quick access and which come with an added set bonus. For example, matching a set of magic skeleton parts pops up a notification that this is a the “Skeleton Mage”. This set will have all of its component stats plus benefits like lower summoning cost and higher unit power. The Skeleton Mage can then be summoned again from the library as long as the parts are available. Custom combinations can also be saved although they won’t get set bonuses. Fun element of discovery and collect-em-all.

The theme is distasteful but at least it’s silly instead of grimdark.
