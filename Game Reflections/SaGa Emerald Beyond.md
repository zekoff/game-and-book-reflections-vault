Having played [[SaGa Scarlet Grace]], I knew to expect an usual approach to world design, both mechanically and visually. This game is similar. The writing isn’t to my tastes, and this game commits the cardinal sin of having very slight input lag every time you press a button to manipulate a menu or to advance dialogue. However, the combat is unique and complex enough to have drawn me back in even after taking short breaks to play other games again. I feel like I haven’t cracked the code on the combat yet, but that I will with time, and I’ll be rewarded for it.
