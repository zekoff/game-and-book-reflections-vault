Entering or exiting the basic Equipment menu takes 7 to 8 seconds each time. The interface is manipulated by moving a cursor from one box to the next with no specific gamepad concessions. It's incredible that a game this old runs so poorly. Goblinz has dropped dramatically in my eyes after these last two games. [[Terraformers]] must have been a huge leap forward for them. I am still excited to see what they do next. 

The game was released in 2019. That's far enough back that it perhaps shows some of its era in design. Stats abound and equipment imparts fairly minor tweaks to those stats. Combat is squarely in the mold of classic JRPGs. Several characters of varying classes with four skills costing a reverse mana resource. 

I realized too late that Goblinz is the publisher but in no way the developer. Asteroid Lab is the developer. I always hated the name “Goblinz” because I think it's puerile. I forgave it because they supposedly created one of my favorite games. Now I firmly hate them and it.
