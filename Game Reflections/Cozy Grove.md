Flash portal [[Animal Crossing - New Horizons|Animal Crossing]]. I appreciate that it surfaces tags on furniture. I expect that these are used to pick what decorations will meet various needs. Extremely similar to AC other than there is story to work through. I'm not sure why I'd play this instead.

It does meet the objective of being cozy. The ghosts are not unsettling at all. The music is nice and forgettable. In fact I noticed myself not using the run button. I was content to amble around at the default speed.
