Picking the game up again, so its log entry is reflected here in 2024, though I played many hours in 2023 before I started this log. The HD-2D style continues to be lovely, and Partitio has no business being as likable as he is. But he never once looks at the camera. His voice actor leans completely into it, the character is somehow a rube without being a buffoon. Probably because he’s just so darned nice.

Have worked on a couple of side quests since jumping back in. They’re nifty. They are somewhat unlike many standard RPG quests in that they give you a defined endpoint but some variability in how you’d get to that endpoint. You need the three Sacred Candles. You can pilfer them, buy them, beat someone up and take their stuff… and of the three, looks like one of them can’t be found in the city so you must look elsewhere. It really does allow for roleplaying in that way. And the day/night cycle means it’s not always perfectly obvious where to go because the same people might be (often are) in different places at different times of day.

It’s still a wonder to me that most every single NPC has a little backstory that you can access via the Inquire/Interrogate/Bribe options. And each of those NPCs has a different skill you get if they’re added to you party, and yet another different skill you get if you duel them. Generous and intricate.

Scanning over the world map, I note that I’ve probably completed just under half of the main character story arcs, with 32 hours in a save file. But the game doesn’t feel padded at all -- again, it feels generous and intricate. And I care about where the story is going for each character in their own way. There are no complete misses in this game.

The minimap is brilliant.
