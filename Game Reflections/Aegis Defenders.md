Played demo version. Starting to have existential thoughts about digital games. This is a fun genre mashup with character switching which should be right up my alley. However, I am playing it out in my head. There will be some fun exploration. There will be a little frantic tower defense. There are tile sized pixel characters whose design is informed by lovingly crafted key art of each one. I'll play it for 5 hours and mildly enjoy it. And then I'll walk away no richer in experiences than before. Is that worth $20 when I have such a backlog already?
