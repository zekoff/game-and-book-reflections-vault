Self assured style, like [[Persona 5]]. Strong soundtrack with a clear vision. Excellent voice acting. Battle system looks like it has potential for significant depth.

Unique style is not for me. It's punk but not grunge. The punk of fashion and style. Really, the original The World Ends With You (I think that was the name?) is the only thing so similar. The Persona similarity is more in how it is so confident in its own style.
