The way that Monolith commands “sense of scale” is unparalleled. Within moments the game can transition naturally from a potentially first-person conversation among party members, to an over-the-shoulder trip down Armory Alley gearing up for a mission, to a camera pulled far back showing towering rock pillars and mighty trees. Fast travel is convenient

Another way the game captures sense of scale is the way traversal is limited. It creates a surprising intimacy with the terrain when a jump is just out of reach. Similarly, there are wide open spaces where you must simply cross on foot. And while you run, you can put it on auto-run, and look around at how huge your surroundings are. It’s such a magic trick to have a game where I feel equally unsurprised by an anime triple-somersault finisher tag-team Overdrive combo with a lightsaber followed by a long jog and a thoughtful moment trying to find the entrance to a cave.

World design. Reminds me most of [[The Legend of Zelda - Tears of the Kingdom|TotK]]'s Depths. You can see a spot, and know you could get there, but not know how. It may require a climb up a switchback mountain path which had an entrance hidden in a cave. There could always be something around the next corner or over the next hill, but there could also be something you walked right by and didn’t notice.

Another signature of Xenoblade Chronicles games is the balance between party size and enemy numbers. A single enemy of similar power level is a suitable challenge and make take 30-60 seconds to defeat. Accidentally pulling a second enemy is often enough of a threat to disengage. This is a stark contrast to most JRPG-influenced games, where an enemy party will usually be about the size of the player party if not larger. This also contributes to the sense of scale. You can finish a fight with a giant wolf-thing which had you on the ropes. Then you swivel the camera to see a thirty-foot tall turtle-thing and think “yikes”.

Skells are handled in a surprising and effective way. They feel powerful due to their jumping ability and speed and higher stats. Plus the fantasy of them being giant robots. They aren’t all-powerful though. They can be destroyed through lack of care. They are also physical objects in the world. If you hop out and walk away from them, they don’t magically appear when you enter combat. Another nice nod is that they can’t target all enemy appendages. Only on foot can you do that. And they conversely make on-foot feel powerful. Ground arts and skills are more granular. There’s more ability to craft builds. (At least at the point through which I’ve played.)

It’s been interesting to recognize this game as a partially a product of both its time and its setting. It’s setting is important tonally. It takes place in the near-future of our Earth and our time. Fifty years or so, and it assumes some magic-adjacent technology advances. Still certainly “science fantasy”. But it’s grounded in American trappings. Militaristic aesthetics dominate. Gear, especially early gear, is cargo pants, bulletproof body armor, rifles. Music is decidedly not orchestral. Not that there isn’t a sweeping score in places, but there are many songs with lyrics. Sort of rap-rock. Urban? I’m not sure what the genre or term would be. It exudes “cool”. Not “stylish”, not “gritty”, not “cynical”, but swagger, confidence, unselfconscious bravado.

These games are some of the finest on offer. And this one, like the others, is very special.

With Skell flight now, and sure enough. Those giant rock spires that looked like letterbox decor are traversable. Of course. Incredible. You can fly right over the wall and into New LA.
