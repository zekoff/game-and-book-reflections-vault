Easily digestible from start to finish. The gameplay is simple platforming with a shovel as tool. The shovel can swipe like an axe, dig like a… shovel, and perform a downward strike ripped from [[Shovel Knight]] and which doubles as a high jump. The crank is used infrequently for a very specific obstacle. The platforming won’t knock [[Mario]] off the throne. Hitboxes continually catch you off guard and the Playdate’s gamepad requires way too much pressure to be held continually or to flip back and forth to change directions.

From a structural perspective, the game presents itself as a linear platformer at first, with a title screen and a tutorial as the first stage. There are “lives”, which are really hit points, and some pickups. But surprises do abound. Beating a stage gives you a ranking and then kicks you right back to the title screen. Starting again presents another procedurally generated stage assembled from a variety of hand-built segments. Picking up puzzle pieces and then completing a stage will progressively unlock chunks of several posters. That’s when it really gets surprising, and the Playdate schtick starts to come through the most strongly.

Forrest Byrnes is the player character and is a cartoon forest ranger running through flames. The game seems fairly harmless. “Cartoon violence” as an age rating would describe it. The first chunk or two of a poster shows the expected “only you can prevent forest fires” sort of art. But then more chunks are revealed and start to turn the posters darker. On one poster a revealed chunk suddenly shows a Satan tail poking up from the ground and flames licking around a child. Another chunk suddenly shows the face of Forrest lit from below by a match and staring down. The fully revealed posters eventually show truly dark phrases and sights. Forrest standing on a pile of ignited children heads. “One Careless Camper -- You!” A burning forest with the disembodied head of Forrest in the sky and the words “THIS SHAME HANGS OVER US”.

It looks from the credits like the game is associated with Campo Santo and the [[Firewatch]] brand. I 100%’d the game in about an hour. It’s very sessionable if desired, it doesn’t wear out its welcome, and the aesthetic is pure Playdate.
