A western fantasy version of [[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]. Slightly smaller scale but still grand strategy.

The game is in the tactical layer. Strategic provides a reason to select fight locations and also allows for preparation. Tactical layer is fairly standard with emphasis on Zones of Control. The matchups between units are complex but ultimately still understandable. Each unit can have an array of specialized abilities and I often spend minutes checking each allied and enemy unit for their statistics before committing to maneuvers.

The story interstitials, although I don’t currently care much about them, do serve to break the pace up between battles. They are useful for that reason alone.

I like how quests provide strategic tension. They give something for benched units to do. Because they take a unit out for a season, there is a balance between buffing your army over time through quests while still leaving enough forces in place to defend and attack cities.
