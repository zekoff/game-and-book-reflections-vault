Wiped out my old island from Covid era and started over in the hopes that everyone in my family would also eventually be playing together. Still a comforting and oddly compelling game. There is more structure and “gaminess” than I remember, what with Nook Points and Nook Plus quests and collecting X of Y to build Z. But I still find it most fun when I don’t worry about advancement and just play around fishing.

When describing it to Lauren, I extemporaneously described it as “soothing, with light goal-oriented play”.
