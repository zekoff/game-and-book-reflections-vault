You just… keep playing to try and get a higher score?! It’s an arcade game?!

[[Jupiter Hell]] is a re-implementation of DoomRL. It’s a true, traditional roguelike. I remember a story one of the developers told about talking with a reviewer. The reviewer had reflected on how Jupiter Hell reminded him of “a roguelike except for it’s turn-based and takes place on a grid.” Hilarious because, of course, that’s what roguelike is supposed to mean. Satryn DX is the same. I can imagine someone coming at it for review and saying that it’s a roguelike without metaprogression.

This does put me in mind of C. S. Lewis and the devolution of the term “gentleman.” It used to mean a man who owned land. Its meaning moved in steps and ended up as “a nice person.” The complaint Lewis rightly makes is that there were plenty of words already for “nice gentlemen.” Now we have no single word for “a man who owns land.” Thus the language is actually poorer for the shift in this word. Roguelike is the same.w

I jumped right in after starting it. When I died the first time, it showed a screen summarizing my game, then gave me the option to either restart or go back to the main menu. I was actually confused at first. I couldn’t find where it should have been showing my the metaprogression currency or XP gains. I actually went back to the main menu and read through the in-game manual to see what I was missing. I even had to mentally translate the word “run” to “game” while writing this. What a stark and simple contrast to the pervasive world of roguelikes now. A straightforward score-chaser that you play simply for the joy of playing.

The flip side of the coin is that I felt like I had my fill of the game after three runs. I would have stuck with it longer had there been a metaprogression. It’s a jarring feeling and reveals something almost sinister with the current zeitgeist of roguelikes. Quite a palate cleanser at the same time. I feel refreshed that I played the game, experienced the basic loop within thirty minutes, and can uninstall it with confidence that I both enjoyed it and am done with it.

Things I liked:

- Brings about the flow state of a good shooter very quickly. I began to weave between shots before I even knew why I was doing it.
- The enemies can’t turn as fast as they can move in a straight line. You can avoid them by zigging and zagging or hugging the edge of the screen. At the same time, the edge of the screen gives you less room to maneuver, so puts you in greater danger.
- Enemies resist bunching together which means you can’t trivialize them by moving in circles. This contrasts with [[Brotato]] which is the most recent game I’ve played with similar gameplay.
- Simple graphics striking a balance between visual noise to cloud the stage and clear threats that you know to avoid.
- Friends are automatically collected at the end of the stage if they are still alive. This prevents the degenerate play pattern of leaving a single low-threat enemy alive so you can go around and vacuum up final consumables. Similar to how [[Wild Bastards]] handles pickups -- if you miss them or leave them during the stage, they’ll be collected when you win, and you avoid the same un-fun play pattern.
- I didn’t understand what Friends were for before I read the manual. In my first run I still made a particular effort to pick them up despite that. This was purely because of their characterization as Friends. Only after reading the manual did I understand how they are the ticket to score multiplier. A neat fit between theme and mechanics.
- The game definitely has a rich-get-richer loop. The faster your score goes up means the more powerups you get, which means the faster your score goes up, and the more friends you collect means the bigger your multiplier, which means more pickups, when means more quickly reducing the threat to friends, which means a better multiplier and more pickups…
