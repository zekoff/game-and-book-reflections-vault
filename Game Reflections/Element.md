Unconventional RTS. Has a double rock-paper-scissors of Earth/Water/Air assets as well as Attack/Defense/Resource assets. On top of that are Support and Missile elements which don’t fit neatly into the RPS formula and disrupt it pleasantly. One oddity is that you must not destroy the enemy base until you’ve mined enough of the victory point resource. I have lost several games because I failed to delay long enough. Effect is very important. It prevents matches from becoming a simple slugfest. It caught me off guard and irritated me but upon reflection I understand why it’s there.
