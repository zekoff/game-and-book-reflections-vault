This game is exactly the reason I often take a chance on games. It was unadvertised and received lukewarm reviews on Steam. Plus, it’s the sort of PC-first game that often doesn’t transition well to consoles, and when games like this do get ported to console you can bet the Switch port will be the worst of all worlds. But it is way more fun that it has any right to be in light of all this.

It’s a strategy game about settling on a new planet. It is very crunchy. Triangular tiles have a type, a feature, and many additional attributes that can change over time. Adjacency bonuses are very important. Tiles can be changed in various ways. There’s a giant research tree. There are competing companies, neutral cultures, ruins that give superpowers, six categories of eight buildings, land and water building, crafting, dozens of resources… it’s the opposite of elegance. Maximalist? But it works very well. Pollution, emissions, and climate change play a large role. There is a compelling sense of building up a civilization and advancing in capability. It also has a nice graphical trick of giving you full pan-and-zoom over a planet. You can zoom out to a strategic view at the push of a button. Surprisingly, the UI is very well adapted to consoles, as are the controls.

Unfortunately, I hit two crashes in a short amount of time, which dissuades me from continuing to play the Switch port. If I could get a stable version of the game this might be in the rotation for me similar to the way [[Civ 6]] was for many years.

Came back after a patch stabilized the game. Played through several more games and grew in understanding of the systems. I feel a little let down by how the challenge ultimately comes from competing corporations. It's not a bad approach and it works for Civ-likes. What else could have worked? A race against the environment to grow your cities. A tension just to balance out your civ and be sustainable. A straight city builder, although that might remove too much challenge. Really what I didn't like was how cramped the planets were with even two other corporations. That is compounded by the fact that they can take your land. There's a sabotage system that reminds me of Offworld Trading Company. The opportunity cost of each tile is one of the most surprising things about the game that ends up being the crux of it. 

A maximalist game design. Throw more mechanics at it until you're out of ideas. Given that, it works better than it has any right to.

Triangular tiles are less intuitive to me than hex tiles.
