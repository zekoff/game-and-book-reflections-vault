My favorite city-builder! I am playing again now that a Switch port has been released.

One of the defining features is certainly the variable production chains. This combines with two other factors to create the core strategic tension. The first is that you don’t know what you’ll find on the map. You know any given map will only populate with a subset of the complete list of resources in the game. Furthermore, you uncover those resources by exploration and you can’t count on any certain one. The other factor is that you will only have a subset of buildings available to you. The net is that the game is about cobbling together resource chains.

Each city can have several pivot points over the course of its evolution. Finding a particularly rich glade or getting a particularly powerful Cornerstone ability may be enough to shape your remaining building picks around them. Another pivot point can be when you never draw a lynchpin building for the strategy you were pursuing and decide to make do with something different. Still another can be when you have particular success with trading and decide to go all-in on Amber generation and then trade to make up for deficits.

The game hides its rubber-banding well but there are a couple of systems that allow it. The longer the game goes on and the more the Queen’s Impatience grows, the lower the Hostility of the forest gets. As villagers depart or die the food consumption becomes less. This means that the game will tend towards a tense but manageable state. It helps avoid the failure spiral where you get behind a success curve and by that very fact you can’t catch up. It also helps avoid the walking dead problem, where you have really lost the city an hour ago but don’t know yet.

Recently I was stretching myself by taking on my first Seal mission at a higher difficulty than I was comfortable with. Early in the mission I mistimed the completion of a Forbidden Glade event by, with absolutely literal precision, two seconds. The punishment was the death of 14 of my 16 villagers. (I thought the game had bugged at first. It took me a couple of minutes to even figure out what I had done wrong -- but once I realized it I knew it was clearly and avoidably my fault.) I then rebuilt the city from two villagers to a successful settlement and a complete Seal. I can’t think of another game off the top of my head that could allow a rebound from such a disaster while still feeling like I earned the rebound rather than getting a handout from a game that scaled its difficulty using other heavy-handed methods.

Settlements take two to three hours to complete. I’m not sure what I think about this length. It’s enough to really familiarize yourself with each settlement. The flipside of the coin is that it occasionally feels like a slog. I think that’s perhaps due to the meta layer of unlocking things. Sometimes when I know a settlement is headed for victory, I just want to skip to getting my rewards and unlocking new toys. That is the critical problem with metaprogression. It takes away some of the joy of the inner loop.
