Played on Game Pass instead of Switch, less to save money (although I wouldn’t have bought it full price without trying it first), and more because I didn’t want to suffer through the inevitable load times on Switch.

Clever and fresh, and owes much to (I can’t believe I’m saying this) [[Mario+Rabbids]]. There is a clear underlying square grid, but the direct character movement adds a lot to the feeling of fluidity, and the inclusion of direct melee attacks as both an offensive and a setup option adds a lot of tactical flexibility. The cover system looks like [[XCOM]] but is actually quite different. Even flanked, an enemy still resists damage while in any cover at all. The use of tall cover as a binary “no damage taken” when not flanked makes it meaningful but still very understandable.

The “1 More” implementation is slick in how it translates that key element of Persona combat into the tactics world. Even this owes something, I think, to the zombies added in XCOM 2 War of the Chosen -- an enemy type that almost becomes a resource. Spending an action point on a vulnerable enemy refunds that point, encouraging you to set up chains, and adding the idea of trying to “run the table” as you would in billiards games.

It’s wild how much even this game still stands in the shadow of the XCOM reboot. XCOM truly did create a new template for tactics games, even though it’s been productively iterated upon by many games since then.

The chibi presentation of this game is neat because it offers some additional artistic freedom by not prompting direct comparisons between Tactica and vanilla P5. This is distinct from the [[Persona 5 Strikers]] approach, where the art direction was to mimic the exact style of P5 as closely as possible. It sort of succeeded, but not perfectly, and ended up in the uncanny valley where it wasn’t exactly P5 and so didn’t meet those expectations, but also wasn’t distinct enough to stand on its own.
  
And the style of Persona just never gets old, the self-confident flash and flair of animations, transitions, menus…
