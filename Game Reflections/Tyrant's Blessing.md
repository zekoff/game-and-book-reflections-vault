Very similar to [[Into the Breach]]. So far, its key difference is the use of a “Shade” mechanic instead of buildings to protect. When characters move, they leave behind a shade of themselves for one turn. That shade can take damage just like the character. It’s a sort of a building that can end up moving every turn, when thought of in ITB terms. However, it’s unintuitive. Even after several successful battles, I still haven’t developed a clear reasoning about what dispels shades. The controller UI is a little buggy as well. This is clearly a port of a PC-first game. Tooltips hang around on the screen after using a button to move around. The touchscreen does work in handheld mode on the Switch though, which is kind of neat in theory although I haven’t used it in practice. It’s too soon to make any observations about the overall campaign structure.

This game certainly doesn’t feel filed to a fine point like ITB does. Other than some UI wonkiness, there’s nothing I can point to as broken, yet it doesn’t have the same level of perfect polish and economy of design that ITB does.

Fired up Into the Breach as soon as I completed my first run of Tyrant's Blessing (which was my first run, period). Some things immediately jumped out at me. I remembered how much emphasis there is on redirecting enemy attacks in ITB, and in using the enemies to sometimes hurt each other. There was little or none of that in TB. ITB also looks cleaner and more readable. Both games have an isometric perspective, but in ITB the camera angle is from on higher. The UI communicates game state more clearly in ITB. The theme makes WAY more sense when trying to understand the mechanics. Protect people in buildings, rather than this very difficult to grasp mechanic of “Shades.” Also having a power grid to protect instead of just your characters gives another axis of decision making. In TB, your characters are the whole game (no power grid or buildings).

From an overall campaign perspective, TB works ok. You can take on missions as many as you want, and the enemies seem to scale with in game passage of time. The lives system of Guardians works fine. The equipment in TB also works fine. The pilot growth in ITB is replaced by equipment in TB, I guess. I miss pilot XP although it does help that the gold and therefore acquired items are more easily transferrable than pilot XP.

TB is also one of those games where there's just tiny bits UX of friction everywhere, and it adds up.

The writing in TB and world building is better than I expected, but doesn't hold a candle compared to ITB.

There is some unfairness when I compare how intuitive the rules of TB are compared to ITB. I’m heading into TB fresh, as I’m comparing my level of understanding with ITB in which I’ve spent dozens if not potentially hundreds of hours. That said, I believe the thematic dressing does so much more for the understandability of ITB than it does for TB. The Shade mechanic feels completely shoe-horned in, an attempt to do something mechanically a little different than ITB. But it’s less understandable from a purely mechanical perspective, and absolutely invalid from a thematic perspective. In TB, you only leave a shade if your character was targeted by an enemy attack at the beginning of the turn, and then you move (not dash or skill-move). That inconsistency took me a full run to internalize, and even then I only grasped it because of sheer brute forcing an understanding by paying close attention to when shades appeared or not. Even once you have an understanding mechanically, there’s no thematic tie to why Shades appear. Perhaps it’s buried deep in the lore, but even then it doesn’t help learn the game. ITB does have some mechanical “cheating” with why things work as they do, but it’s tied to a way where it doesn’t take a huge logical leap to buy in. You can reset a turn -- well, it’s a localized time distortion, which makes sense in a game that’s framed as a multiverse or time loop game.

TB is an interesting experience in cloning a singular game: it makes ITB look even more brilliant by comparison, because you see how all of the little pieces fit together in a way that perhaps they couldn’t have otherwise. TB is a sum-of-its-parts game. ITB is greater than the sum.

One more note: there is freedom in ITB having mech teams curated. Later on you can unlock the ability to form your own team, but that’s for achievements and/or advanced players. TB gives you too much freedom to select bad part compositions.

Also, the addition of a pet is… strange. It’s a fourth unit you have to deal with, which adds cognitive load. But it’s a gimped unit, so you don’t even get the full extra benefit from the additional cognitive load.
