Same as [[20 Minutes Till Dawn]] -- bought at a heavy discount for the purpose of analysis.

This one is much more in the line of [[Vampire Survivors]]. It adds a manually-triggered and infrequently-available special ability that is different for each character. But this is one button press and doesn’t take away from the simplicity of VS. (In VS, there was already one button in addition to the thumbstick. Used to selected powerups, etc. The difference is that here the button has a use during normal gameplay.) Graphics are improved but certainly that’s a low bar to clear. They are generic mobile game fantasy graphics but have 3D models.

Weapon evolutions are much more readable although not necessarily more straightforward. The builds are still split into weapons and trinkets. Each trinket has an elemental affinity. Weapons will show you which two elemental powers they require in order to evolve. There is flexibility then in knowing you need a “fire” elemental trinket so you’ll be able to evolve your weapon later, but also being able to potentially pick between two different trinkets which both give a fire affinity. More flexibility than VS’s static pairs for evolution, but at the same time more understandable especially at first.

No ranged attacks from enemies that I’ve seen so far. However, the stages are also much more full of obstacles. A tradeoff in tactical considerations but the result is roughly the same.

AoR is more to my taste than 20m and much more in line with VS. The central mechanical difference that sets them apart is the presence of twin-stick shooting.
