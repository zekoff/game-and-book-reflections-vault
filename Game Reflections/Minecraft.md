I loved this game when I was a cool alpha player. My fondest memories are of building my own castle complete with redstone machinery. This is a game that existed partially in my head. Ultimately this is the game’s superpower. It’s detailed enough to be suggestive but abstract enough to allow interpretation.

I’ve come back to it in its “Bedrock” incarnation which, of all the cardinal sins, requires an online connection even to play a local world by yourself. INTOLERABLE. But I play it because my children are interested. They predictably prefer creative mode. To the game’s credit, it is a phenomenal Lego toybox in creative mode, and I’ve enjoyed it being a family activity. I have dipped my toes in the water with the Marketplace, and that’s an absolute blood-soaked nightmare hellscape. The Marketplace is perhaps the first time in my life where I’ve seen something I used to love and realized it has passed me by.
