Neat graphical effects. Clever in the way that it shifts between a rectangular corridor with two-axis movement, and an infinite tunnel with one-axis movement. You gain speed as you survive, which puts you into more danger. Losing a life also takes some of your speed off. The corridors get more dangerous as you progress, which means losing a life reduces the danger.

There are multiple control options. The one with the crank and gyro is the most well suited to the gameplay, but the gyro is such an obnoxious way to provide input for a device like this. You have to turn the screen away from your face to use it. And the more sharply you need to control, the more you have to tilt, so the less able you are to see the screen.
