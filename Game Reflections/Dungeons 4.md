Played about 10 minutes through Game Pass. The game is aggressively self-confident, which did have some good side-effects. The voice-acting is adequate and the graphics are competent, with one of the specific graphical effects coming across as almost entrancing (the warp of good-tinted land to evil-tinted). However, the script and cartoon violence is obnoxious to the point that it must be an artistic choice. My generous characterization is that the over-the-top gore and snark is meant to be fourth-wall breaking. I suspect it is the kind of choice that some people will enjoy tremendously, although I recoiled from it and it ultimately drove me away from the game before I could test whether there is systemic or mechanical depth to enjoy.
