Its parody elements are fourth-wall-breaking but aren’t condescending, world-weary, or ironic. The opposite of my pet-peeve humor -- the kind that says “you get the joke right? We’re better than that.” It thus accomplishes a rare thing in that it’s genuinely funny at times. One joke sticks out. Something like:

Character 1: “When the great hero arrives, will we be able to join forces with her?”

Character 2: “It’s the 80’s, hon. It’ll be a ‘him’. And he’ll be white. Or Asian. It’s complicated.”

The game revels in its 80’s graphics and animations. The art is striking. Some of the character designs are off-putting but they ultimately work because the game acknowledges them directly. Each character has a set of stats. All of them share PWR, SPD, and LIFE ranked from one to four stars. Each one also has another unique stat which has no impact on gameplay but which is an excellent joke. Fighter’s bonus stat is IQ which is 2 of 4. The underwear-clad Ninja has the extra stat ARMR, which is 1 of 4. The plump Amazon has the stat PUDG which is 4 of 4. Cute stuff.

Gameplay wise it’s a little bit of a hybrid. It’s squarely action RPG and requires constant button mashing. Ultimately that’s the reason I can’t play it. But it weaves in many other genre elements. Tower defense is a non-trivial portion. Some characters can create defensive turrets or barricades, and most can move barricades and turrets around, and all can heal damaged emplacements. The castle that moves around the map follows rails which are often blocked or need to be re-routed, so there’s a time-sensitive puzzle element. There’s also a little bit of resource management loop as gold can be spent to 1) build defensive structures mid-mission, 2) boost stats between missions, or 3) power up the castle and unlock abilities between campaign arcs.

The more I write about it, the more I wish the button-mashing wasn’t so heavy. I could see myself diving into this game for a while.
