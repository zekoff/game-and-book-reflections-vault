Time travel is worked in well narratively and mechanically. It is framed as your avatar being able to see visions of the future. Meaning that your gameplay is moving forward into the future, and rewinding brings you closer to the present. You can do a local rewind which brings you up to a few seconds backwards. This is mapped to a button press, and is a limited resource, but can be used frequently. There is also a more meta sort of rewind, where you can go back to previous save points not just in locality, but in temporality. The framing for this is that the planet will suffer a catastrophic failure of its core containment field 20 minutes from the start of the game. By reverting to a save point, you can rewind the clock. The most lovely and interesting touch is that this is represented in the menu as a “time tree”. Nodes split off from the initial save point as you make different decisions. You can navigate the time tree you are building, delete nodes off it, or progress in different directions with different objectives from the initial point. While you only retain physical pickups in each of your current timelines, you retain all knowledge from any timelines. Major upgrades are represented as data packets which transfer across timelines.

I ended up hitting some progression walls based on my lack of understanding what the game was signaling to me. At that time, I went to a walkthrough to see how to bust through the wall. I moved forward and grabbed the next major ability enhancement, but it was underwhelming -- a strong attack option which doubles as a “cloud step” function like in The Messenger. This underwhelming upgrade drove me back to the walkthrough to see what upgrades were still ahead of me, and none of them were of significant mechanical interest. Furthermore, the walkthrough indicated that there were many more twitch-based challenges ahead of me, and I lost interest at that point. Overall though, this is a clever game.
