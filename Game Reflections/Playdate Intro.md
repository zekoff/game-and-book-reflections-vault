When first booting up the Playdate console, there’s an interactive “tutorial” that requires you to press each button once. It’s a delightful introduction to the console. There’s plenty of flash, and it shows off how responsive the controls are and how crisp the screen is despite being small. It wisely saves the crank for last. Winding the crank eventually results in an explosion of clockwork gibbets with a cute little fanfare that calls 8-bit [[Super Mario Bros. series]] to mind.

The last time I remember a game console giving me that same feeling of joy was when I put on the Oculus headset for the first time. Granted, the Playdate is dramatically more limited in scope, and the delight was more short-lived, but it successfully replaces the awe of first-time VR with the whimsy of a truly frivolous device.
