Released in 2016. I can see this being an indie darling at that time. It’s quite difficult to come in first place against the competing (CPU) explorers, but it’s not terribly difficult to reach the finish line. The most special thing about this game is the feeling of actual exploration. The map is full of dead ends and does not seem particularly tailored to the player experience. It’s refreshing in that way. It also has definable features that you can begin to look out for. Common features include a pyramid hidden in a forest and a shrine hidden in a circular mountain range. You can also generally count on your final destination being medium-to-long-range away from your landing location. There are a few concessions to playability in that generation algorithm. For example, it seemed to me that a long mountain range would have at least one pass in it allowing you to progress towards the final destination. That information can typically be used to know there might be a mountain pass somewhere. In combination the exploration becomes a little bit about learning the procedural generator but mostly about attempting to follow paths of least resistance in the attempt to explore efficiently. The lookahead distance is fairly small, making sight range an incredibly valuable resource.

“Path of least resistance” is influenced heavily by the limited resources you can choose to carry. Bringing picks and ropes, or torches, or snowshoes, or barrels of water, make certain terrain more accessible. They are very limited resources though.

Combat is about rolling a set of dice based on the characters in your party and then combining them into combos which do damage or protect the party. Combat is punishing. There is little or no UI aid to knowing which die belongs to whom and therefore what the odds might be of fishing for a specific face. Even the least dangerous creatures pose a mortal threat. The most dangerous are essentially a guaranteed loss. The difficult pairing here is that creatures have a massive range of where they can roam. Combined with the short default sight range, this means that by the time you see a creature, it’s too late to do anything about it. It’s possible that there are map tells which indicate a creature is roaming nearby. But, since I never learned that (if it exists), it often felt like I stumbled randomly into a total party kill just by performing the basic act of exploration. That’s the absolute fundamental mechanic and pleasure of the game. This is probably what eventually drove me away.

I respect the game even though I don’t really like it.
