Better [[Hades]]. There is a longer delay between uses of Dodge. There is also the addition of a tool to slow enemy moment in the form of the Cast. In combination, the game becomes more tactical -- sustaining a burst of damage right now usually means that you made the mistake several seconds ago. This is a massive shift in the way the game must be approached.

The addition of so many different and new crafting materials add another reason to favor one path over another during runs.

Arcana cards force difficult decisions about builds. The fact that some cards are only activated based on the configuration of other cards is an excellent touch. The downside to this is that the Arcana cards cause significant but easily-forgotten changes in build success. Overall the game suffers from the very common modern roguelike problem of stacking so many modifiers on top of one another that it’s difficult to remember which ones are in play between different runs.

Success hinges primarily on cobbling together a “broken” build. The difference between having three strong moves to vary versus one broken move to spam is the difference between defeat and victory. In this way, the largest part of most runs is the process of building towards a broken build by the final area. Channeling the randomness along the way.

The story ending (credits roll ending) was unsatisfying. It’s unclear to both Melinoe and the player how the alternate timelines fit together. It’s also unclear why Melinoe must return to shadow and continue ascending and descending over and over as she did before defeating Chronos. To allow a roguelike to diegetically continue after a story’s conclusion is a difficult landing to stick, but this doesn’t stick it.

Upon continued play my opinion of the build crafting has softened. Good builds are important but careful play is at least equal in importance. Repeated fights with bosses provide the opportunity to learn them better. It's not common for me to beat some of the earlier bosses without taking a hit. I appreciate that there is a healthier balance between skill and numeric advantage than I first thought.
