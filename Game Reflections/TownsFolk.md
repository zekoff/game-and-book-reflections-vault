Mobile game, 4X-y tile laying game (in the guise of a town builder), worth noting as an exercise in understanding how it compares to other strategy games broadly in this space.

The map is expanded through exploration and most tiles are filled with something when you reveal them. Some are filled with natural resources that can be consumed or tapped, but about half of them are event tiles containing an obstacle that cannot be removed. It significantly constrains the number of locations where you can build anything at all.

Adjacency bonuses and maluses are a huge component of the game. Most buildings have significant modifiers based on adjacency. About half the buildings can’t be built at all without a matching adjacency bonus. This, paired with the tile content, means that the most limiting factor in the game is being able to place buildings at all, to say nothing of placing them optimally.

Constrained resources. Buildings require an investment of a different resource than the one the building will generate. Many times the investment is of an amount which would take in-game days to recoup. It’s easily possible to create a death spiral where the buildings you’ve placed aren’t generating enough resources to explore for more land or build anything else.

Research is also highly limited. Each map starts with enough research points to pick two or maybe three options from a research tree. The research perks make a medium amount of difference. They don’t fundamentally change the way you approach the level, but they can allow you to lean into the map or to cover for weaknesses.

Pace of game (realtime but also slow). The game positively crawls, even on the fast-forward setting. Minutes pass between the time you select a tile for exploration and the time the tile is revealed. In between there’s nothing to do but wait. The game has no reflex skill checks but it also makes me feel compelled to pause it when I need to think. In summary in creates a lot of pressure to constantly manipulate the speed setting.

Barbarians and event tiles can easily wreck your settlement. In a game where building a new farm takes two population, a failed event tile can wipe out 50 at once. Barbarians also destroy the entire contents of any tile they cross. Guard towers can be placed to prevent this but take many days to build. This makes exploration a big risk outside of the first ring of tiles.

There are odd event tiles with riddles or decisions. They can completely wreck a run. Failing an event can lead to a consequence like the loss of 50 resources, in a game where many buildings generate one of their resource per turn. The riddles are also static. Once you’ve seen the five or so in rotation, you just repeat what you’ve already done.

The game succeeds in creating an experience where every revealed tile is a tense moment and where every building placement is a weighty decision. It fails in its use of a realtime clock which adds nothing compared to turn-based yet requires manual manipulation.

What would I preserve and what would I do differently? Free up a higher percentage of tiles for building, at least around the core of the settlement. This would make the early phase easier so would need to be compensated by a difficulty ramp as the settlement expands. A death spiral occurs too easily in the beginning phases of a level. Eliminate the event tiles or make them give more significant adjacency bonuses once they have been completed. This would stop these from feeling like dead tiles. Keep the weighty decisions about building placement and the importance of exploration.

OH MY WORD. I checked the settings just now and there’s a turn-based mode. This may relieve the most significant of my issues with the game.

…yes, this alone fixes my biggest issue. The game just went up 2 of 10 points from 5 to 7.

Coming back now after about a week of off-and-on play, I bizarrely ended up hating this game. I documented the reasons in the entry for [[Dawnfolk]]. For a game that started middling, it was a strange experience to see its sails unfold before it was dashed against the rocks.
