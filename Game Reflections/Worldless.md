I need to return to it again after I binged about five hours of it essentially without interruption, but this may be one of those hidden gems, like [[Unsighted]]. The combat system is meaty, almost to the point of being bewildering. It also has one of those special twists that only games can pull off, where there is a thematic and mechanical change a ways into the game which recontextualizes everything in the game (the swapping between light and dark avatars). The way it handles its progression is also fascinating. There are points to drop in on a skill tree, but very few upgrades that just make you flat out more powerful or generate “bigger numbers”. Points typically unlock an additional skill which raises your power level but only if you execute use of the power skillfully.

Came back in June 2024 and rolled the credits in another 5 hours, so 10 total to complete. Didn't quite 100% it but collected most of the items and achievements. There was a lot that turned out to be technically optional but truly needed to make harder enemies and bosses viable. Combat remains the standout even with the beautiful aesthetic. The story left much open ended. Open to interpretation. Perhaps a war in heaven that cycles with a newly fused pair of stars? I love that the white star gave its life for the black star. I'm not sure what it means that the black star absorbed it. Gave it new life? Turned on it? 

The switching between stars with their move sets is certainly the signature mechanic, both in exploration and in combat. The combat is tight and fair but very difficult. It's hell on the fingers. Mostly because it's intense and I'm jamming the buttons but the chord presses don't help. Despite that, it doesn't quite require twitch reactions. Most moves are telegraphed well and though I may mess up the right response, it feels like it's on me. 

A brilliant game when all is said and done.
