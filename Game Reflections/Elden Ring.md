Having played an hour a couple of years ago on my brother’s Playstation, it wasn’t revelatory like perhaps it would have been. But I’m also getting to sink my teeth into it more, and not rush.

A decent ways into the game so far. Because of its deliberate pace, even small areas end up feeling significant. The castle you’re pointed to at the beginning (Stormveil Keep?) has a tremendous sense of place, even though it’s really only a few rooms. As I look back on exactly how much game has been crammed into a small place, I’m amazed.

I have hit a wall with Godrick the Grafted, and decided to strike off in another direction from the crossroad area near the beginning. Sure enough, there were things to see in the other direction. When I came back to the crossroads, I was able to easily handle all the enemies in the area, whereas before it seemed nearly insurmountable.
