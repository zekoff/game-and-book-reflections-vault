Another Playdate game that leans into probably the wrong elements of the console. It is essentially trying to pack a grand, UI- and menu-heavy adventure into a console that can’t hold it. It reminds me of TI-80 games that we would pass between friends in middle school. The primary objective was getting a what we thought of as a console game onto a calculator. It wasn’t about creating a good game. It was about building a tech demo and stuffing as many things into it as possible.

One thing this game does benefit from is the literal pocket size of the Playdate. [[Shining Gadget]] still wins out here, but I'm appreciating that the tiny size and battery sipping properties also enable easy pick up and play.

The difficulty in this game is way off. The entry level monster, the rat, can kill you in two hits if you're unlucky. When you die, there doesn't appear to be a penalty other than your loss of time as you're sent to the surface. On the other hand, there are no random encounters. Enemies are specifically placed on certain tiles, and once you've defeated the enemy, they don't come back. The problem is that these enemies are the only way to get resources out of this extremely stingy game. Some of those resources can then be spent on consumables. Which means there are resources then completely removed from the game and unrecoverable. Also, after defeating every enemy I could conceivably beat, I was less than 10% gained of the XP needed to reach character level 2. I had picked up some armor and a marginally improved weapon. But the armor takes permanent damage on each hit and requires spending the gold to repair, again a permanent resource sink. 

I don't think this game is retro so much as fundamentally broken, in the way that the old Plato “dnd” game was fundamentally broken.
