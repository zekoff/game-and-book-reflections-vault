Neat genre blend. The constraint of placing tower defense elements based on the location of your avatar makes the game more intuitive in some ways and less in others. The fact that each of your “towers” is a character which persists sets up some oddities. When moving a character you are often moving them from offscreen somewhere and it can make it hard to do a mental from/to and fully understand the dynamic you are changing.

The unusual theme obfuscates the mechanisms of the game which is something I appreciate. It wasn’t as straightforward for me to see right through to “rapid-fire tower here, level up this thing, collect that resource, guard this pinch point.” The tradeoff of this is that the heavy emphasis on aesthetic perhaps prevented some things that would have made the game more playable. Chief among these would have been the ability to zoom the map far out when placing villagers in defensive locations.

The last stage I played was a good twist. It removed the ability for my avatar to fight and forced me to manage just the tower defense aspects. Placed far away on the spectrum from the boss fights which are reliant on the action game.
