It feels like walking around in one of the hand-painted backgrounds from PS1-era games. Surreal. Warped architecture. Alien shapes but human touches that give it a touch point to reality. Tricks your brain into never being able to slough it off into total fantasy.

Superpowers but still fragile.

Combat tuned so that you can make some mistakes especially early ina battle where you learn patterns and timing. Dodge is easier, parry is difficult but grants AP as well as the chance for a counterattack. Each character having their own thing not only differentiates them but aids in their characterization. 

Build crafting is strongly present and well done though it in itself doesn't bring much new. The freshest thing is the idea that pictos must be equipped for several battles before their associated ability is unlocked for the whole Expedition. This disrupts stable builds and forces a little experimentation every so often. Also makes character builds very flexible and avoids the need for micromanaging equipment. Rewards for exploring are usually very worthwhile. 

Music sound and art. The concussive bubble and sound of a parry is a joy. Facial expressions are well executed and directed and help define the personality of each character. Voice acting well done. Animations, especially in battle, also define characterization. Blessedly no minimap which forces paying attention and feels like exploring. Occasionally gruesome. 

Mystery. All the characters know what to expect but the player does not. Then later neither knows what to expect. They all know something is wrong but not how to fix it. Over everything hang the questions “why? What who? How? Where? When?”

Low friction game. Combat inputs respond immediately. Battles start quickly. Save points spaced for tension but ultimately generous. Ability to immediately retry battles. Pause menu is complex but necessarily so. Regenerating consumables. 

Influences: [[Persona series|Persona]], [[Final Fantasy series|Final Fantasy]], [[Super Mario RPG]], Lost, surely film although I can't point to a specific one. 

No minimap. Changes the game significantly and for the better. 

The exposition comes in meaty chunks after each act. It solidifies and explains the previous events and sets up the new events. In between the plot is carried on straightforward events of rising action as well as the camaraderie of the characters as expressed through exceptional voice talent and animation. 

Themes include family, grief, and an unblinking commitment to the philosophy of I think, therefore I am. Cogito, ergo sum, Renee Descartes. That evil is those in power who do what they think is best without consulting those in their power. 

Very curious now to learn more about the Writers and their conflict with the Painters. 

Cogito, ergo sum. 

I chose Maelle at the end over Verso. I agonized over the decision. The game is about taking power over your own life. Fighting back against people who want to control you because they think they know what's best for you. Maelle represented this perspective. Yet she is also the one who gommaged Alicia with Verso getting a chance to say goodbye. I can see Verso wanting to boot Maelle from the canvas because he gave his life for her and can't bear to have her lose herself in the canvas. 

At the end it's horrific that Maelle creates a new Verso. He just wanted to die. The cut to her painted face is unsettling. 

This game is one of the greats. 30 hours and enjoyed every minute of it. 

At the final boss I did 1.1 million damage in a single stroke. This compared to big hits being 20k in act 3. Maelle, virtuosa stance, level 3 gradient attack Gommaged.
