Of all the games I’ve played that purport to capture the tabletop RPG experience, this has gone farthest. More than once already I’ve made a decision based on “how my character would act” instead of what might be strategically optimal. The comic-book panel presentation works perfectly. It appears that vignettes are hand-crafted and this makes me more willing to read them. I had a brief blush of disappointment when I realized that the story was not fully procedural. After that passed, though, I became more and more thankful as I enjoyed the solid writing. My characters appear to influence what paths I can take in any vignette so it still feels tailored to me while being authored.

Battles so far have been fairly straightforward. There’s obviously a place for brain-burning tactical combat -- I’ve played hundreds of hours of Into the Breach. Pulling back from that changes the pace significantly, however. The balance is split roughly in thirds between story, battle, and overworld. Free diagonal movement has broken me out of muscle memory created by so many of these games in a short number of years.

How does Wildermyth keep the pace in tactical battles? Based on number of tiles and general movement/attack ranges, the maps are perhaps twice as large as Into the Breach, and maybe a fifth of the size of [[XCOM]]. I have three characters now which is currently an [[Into The Breach]] number. The characters are very clearly melee, ranged, and magic. There’s little overlap between what they can or should do on a turn. That makes it easy to pick where they should be positioned and what they should do. That constrained possibility space is probably the biggest factor in the pace.

The Switch just cannot handle the port of this game. I knew it was PC first because I played it on my Steam Deck. I was hopeful that because of its modest approach to the 3D world it would still be at home. It's not. The UI is not cramped yet it is victim to strange quirks. Unit billboards in battles will often appear as flame textures or headless sprites of a different unit type. Making story selections will briefly grind the game to a halt. It was a borderline experience for me until it crashed. That put me over the edge into “wait and see if they patch it.”

One other thing -- characters are NOT made for taking hits. Even the warrior class can be felled in a single turn by a couple of solid hits from average enemies.
