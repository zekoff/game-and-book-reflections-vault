Played about an hour via Game Pass. It’s a serviceable retro FPS. The eponymous Boltgun is neat, although not as earth-shattering as I expected given the reviews I read. The overall move and aim speed is comparatively slow, given that this game is in the vein of classic Doom, where movement speed is the primary form of defense. The chain-sword dash mapped to left trigger does give some additional mobility, and the jump-with-mantle adds verticality and light platforming. Overall this game feels B-tier, and in this case I don’t mean that as a compliment. It’s not quite janky enough to be “so bad it’s good”, but it’s not good enough to make me want to play it instead of something else.
