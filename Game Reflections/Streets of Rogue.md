Almost completely systemic. Quests per level add a basic reason to interact with the simulation. The UI does a reasonable job exposing what’s happening under the simulation. Circles around characters indicate their disposition and there’s a simple UI mode to show what characters own what building. The game has a domino-fall effect like [[Spelunky]] has. Each single and specific interaction between characters follows consistent rules. The emergent behavior comes into play when characters with not-quite-overlapping wants come into contact with one another. This usually causes things to devolve into a grand melee with characters out for each others’ blood. This is definitely a game where much falls back to bump combat similar to Unexplored which is broadly in this space.

Character classes are a real highlight. Each class has a different selection of traits, special conditions, and quests that force you to interact with the simulation in very different ways.

Impressive game!
