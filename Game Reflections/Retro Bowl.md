Redownloaded this after having sunk some hours into it quite some time ago. Played about two hours this go-round. It’s a perfect level of abstraction. Direct control of your team is only available when you’re on offense. On defense the game is quickly simulated in large chunks at a time. Full games take just a few minutes to complete. On offense you are dealt a playcall with receiver routes laid out before you snap the ball. Throws are targeted at a spot on the ground which means you must read the defense and then move the cursor where you want to throw. There’s a button to scramble and also to call a handoff play before the ball is snapped. Basically, it strips down the tactics of offense to the most fundamental level while still feeling like playing a digital football game. Very snappy. Clock management even becomes a part of things.

The football simulation is wrapped in a franchise management simulation. Key players are drafted and leveled up. Their stats make a dramatic difference in the game. Skilled players are good enough that I shaped my play calls around them -- again, boiling things down to a fundamental joy of the game. Playing through games also reveals your needs in the next round of draft picks. It creates a bi-directional relationship where the franchise management feeds the on-field action and vice-versa. It’s just like [[XCOM]] in that way. The core of the game is tactical but it’s deeply intertwined with the strategic.

It would also be possible to play by simulating each game and then just managing the franchise. I didn’t do that but it would give another layer to the game.
