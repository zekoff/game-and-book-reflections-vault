Demo version. Off the cuff I reacted most to the generic setting: Western fantasy through an Eastern lens. It’s mundane by comparison after just completing [[Clair Obscur - Expedition 33]]. The performance as a Switch 1 game is unimpressive. \[Yikes -- found out later I was actually playing a Switch 2 version! Even worse!\] Although, upon reflection, it looks perfectly nice on a system which is now the better part of a decade old. Voice acting and animations are effective. The combat system is basic at the level I engaged with it. No doubt there are wrinkles later and I remember Emerald SaGa having a more unique battle system. The trademark glimmer system, where new moves unlock at random by using other moves, is still pretty fun because it feels like pulling the handle on a slot machine each time.

I only played about an hour but I’m moving on because the story is unlikely to hook me and I don’t see anything yet to indicate that the game will become something dramatically different than this opening half hour.
