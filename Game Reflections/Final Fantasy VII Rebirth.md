Richly produced on a scale that defies belief. It’s very much up its own butt, but it’s also based on one of the few entries in the video game canon that can support this. As I described it to someone, it’s the national epic of the collision between US and Japanese cultures.

Absolutely unadulterated joy. Watching the characters strike their post-battle poses makes me appreciate the original even more -- I see what was actually happening behind those chunky hand-animated polygons. The music continues to strike a nostalgic chord while also standing on its own. And it’s lovely to hear the updates to the music compared to the original.

The battle system is already incredible. Each of the characters has their own distinct identity in combat. I’m beginning to understand the depth and possibility of customization. Characters have way more than in their toolkits than it first appears.

The open world is shocking. It feels like it simply recontextualized the Ubisoft playbook, and yet it works perfectly. At the moment I’m completely stuck in the Grasslands of my own doing. Please, someone push me out of here so I move on.

I remarked at one point that I wanted to be tested by the combat. In the combat simulator, I finally got tested with the Titan summon fight. And the inclusion of the character-specific simulator tutorials was excellent. I was unlikely to pick up many of the nuances till much later, maybe never, especially for characters I haven’t been using regularly. The unique abilities and combat styles for each character make me think most of [[Final Fantasy VI]], which had everything from Mug to Street Fighter inputs.

Blink and you miss it stuff everywhere. The bombing run theme as a jazz number just because I walked into a bar in Junon.
