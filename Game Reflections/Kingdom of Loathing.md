One of my beloved game experiences. The humor hit me just right when I played it. I first encountered it as a middle or highschooler and then dipped my toes in again after college.

To gain access to the chat feature you had to pass a short quiz. One of the questions was "what was the color of George Washington's favorite black horse?"

Meat as currency. 

This is the first game that I ever encountered which used a "prestige" mechanic -- the ability to start your character over from scratch in return for advancement types which would otherwise be unavailable. I suppose this is the same as New Game+ in some ways, which I first encountered in [[Chrono Trigger]].
