Basically, a fast-follow version of [[Dorfromantik]] with a few tweaks. If you’ve played one, you’ve played the other. They are too similar for me to have committed to learning whether there are significantly deep differences, and since I have checked the boxes this type of game offers, I don’t see myself returning to it. As a minor aside, the Switch port uses a menu tile graphic that was sized for widescreen but squished to a square. That sets a surprisingly strong tone -- this is the sort of thing that could have been fixed in 10 minutes with an image editor during the export process, yet carries a disproportionate amount of weight in how much I trust the developer. Contributes to my knee-jerk assessment that this is a fast-follow clone and perhaps even a cash grab.
