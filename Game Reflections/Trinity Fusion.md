Studied at the school of [[Dead Cells]]. Shares with it an overall framework, combat flow, and melding of exploration and upgrade systems.

By default your character has two weapons equipped. A nice twist is that hits with the primary weapon build charge for the secondary weapon. The secondary weapon is significantly more powerful than the primary, which encourages you to spend the secondary resource -- generally a problem for me since I have “consumable anxiety”. In all the RPGs I’ve ever played, I’ve never once used a Megelixir or its equivalent. I have the millstone around my neck of thinking you just never know when you’ll need it, even when you know you’re in the surprise double-final form of the final boss on the final turn.

One of the distinctive Dead Cells elements includes a flash before an enemy uses an attack (which I guess might actually trace back to the Arkham games?),

The game has generally clean and somewhat forgiving hitboxes. Unfortunately, they’re clouded by the decision to use a perspective camera instead of an orthographic camera. The other problem is the visual direction of the character models. The full 3D models look nice when zoomed in during cutscenes. However, that same trait means that they have less defined visual edges when treated as 2D combatants. Even with the character in the center of the screen, there is just some conceptual fuzziness about who is where. There’s also a fairly strong push between character volumes. And instead of colliding and then elastically separating, volumes just get instantly pushed apart or lose all velocity upon collision.

The game seems to encourage exploration. There are teleporters scattered around the stages that make warping from place to place simple. Exploring areas yields treasure chests, upgrades, and the most defining powerup of all: the ability to fuse two of the character classes into one. When you do so you combine the traversal moves and weapons of both characters into one. The game encourages swapping weapons during a run, which I like a lot. Each weapon also has a couple of special moves based on button inputs. These add some variety in addition to the standard attacks and the stats.

The game is a little too stingy with its upgrades. It’s fine and even suitable to have some metaprogression elements. The catch is that core traversal abilities seem to be locked until some story progression is made. Dead Cells did the same, but for some reason it sticks out more here. I think the issue, oddly enough, is that each character’s animations are just on the wrong side of the divide between serviceable and delightful. Because each movement is not that appealing on its own, the standard moveset feels lacking. The overall limit of moves for any one character was probably the right choice since you’ll likely end up combining two. It’s just that it ends up feeling like you start with one gimped character and grow into a complete character instead of starting with a complete character and getting the “breaking the game” feeling when you fuse. Since this is the headline mechanism of the game, this has an outsized feel as a missed opportunity.

I had trouble remembering which character has which ability. This made the choice of fusion fairly arbitrary. It also made it difficult to plan a progression strategy in any given run.

Bosses are absolute damage sponges.

The evade move has a generous helping of i-frames and has just the right amount of feedback when an enemy attack is successfully dodged.
