Surprising game. Had I played this on Game Pass, I would have experimented for 10 minutes and discarded it. However, because I paid for it on Switch instead, I decided to give it “one more try” after an underwhelming initial reaction.

The game is not thoroughly tutorialized, and this ended up adding to its moments of discovery. It has turned out that there are layers to its strategy. Initially the spider-mech and the pilot are both painfully slow and underpowered. And there’s little indication that they’ll improve. But pausing the game, I found skill trees, fed by the minerals found in the mine. Then later, after picking up some items with effects that weren’t intuitive, I found that the skill tree menu can be scrolled to the right -- and that each pickup has its own skill tree. I’ve found alternate weapons for the mech, some tower-defense-style powerups, hidden caves with immediate and powerful boosts.

After playing maybe 5 hours (perhaps 10 runs), I randomly thought… what if I start by going down the wall instead of up? And you know what? A completely different set of biomes, with the missing resources that I’d seen in the skill tree as required, but had never come across before. Again, absolutely fascinating that this wasn’t tutorialized in any way. Now I’m even more excited about continuing to play.

It occurred to me that I’d heard of Alawar before, and sure enough, they also made [[Necrosmith]], another fascinating game, although one with a treacherous Switch port. I played NecroSmith before I started keeping this reflection log, but it brought together some interesting ideas in spite of its distasteful theme. It was of sufficient interest that a “Necrosmith clone” was on my list of potential projects for 1GAM 2023.
