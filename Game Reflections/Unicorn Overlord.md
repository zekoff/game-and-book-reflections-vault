Delightfully overwrought script. Art is gorgeous. Game systems seem crunchy. Certainly this is in the lineage of [[Ogre Battle]] on SNES, down to the language of “liberation” of towns and other points of interest.

Many more hours in, this is a sumptuous game. The art is beautiful and unique, very Vanillaware. The animations are clean in that abstract way of early-2000s flash games -- of discreet parts that move in a pulsing, periodic way based on tweens under the hood.

Tactically, the game is quite good. Units should be built to purpose for each engagement, by reading the field beforehand. There are absolutely hard counters for almost each of the classes, and this encourages compound units that strike exactly with the right counters. However, because units can be comprised of enough individual characters to counter the counters, there is a thoughtfulness about the way units must be built, and also a messiness. It feels like there could be multiple optimal units for a given map. The UI also blessedly supports the idea of swapping characters in out and of units easily. I chose to play on “Tactical” difficulty, one level up from standard, and I’m glad I did, because I sense that it’s forcing me to engage with all of the game systems. Because the counters are so hard, I feel like I couldn’t necessarily skip careful unit composition on a lower difficulty, but I suspect it would give me a little too much flexibility and I’d be likely to steamroll some battles.

There’s only been one chapter-ending battle that forced me to really dig into the full bag of tricks, though, and ultimately I’m glad it did. I felt like there were no perfect counters, and near the end I was just throwing units at a boss until I could grind him down. Honestly, fitting, since this was the final boss in an early game form.

In a neat trick, the battles take place on the same overworld map where your character moves around and interacts with towns. A certain battlefield will be boxed off when combat starts, but towns and mountain ranges are where they are. It keeps the game feeling grounded in its own world. Of the probably two dozen engagements I’ve completed so far, there has been an impressive variety. The ultimate objective is usually some form of “capture the enemy base”, but to get there you may have to take intermediate fortresses as staging areas, or avoid a tower until you can deal with it more effectively, or rush back to protect your own base from an advancing unit.

The realtime movement on the battle map turns out to be a very neat way of handling overall strategy. Units have different mobility levels and strategic-level abilities depending on their composition and leader type. The realtime strategic layer also puts another nice level of indeterminacy into the battles. Will my units make it there before reinforcements arrive? Is it faster to go around an obstacle, or should I sub in a flying unit with an imperfect composition but because it can bypass the difficult terrain? The time limits are not generous, but the readily available pause feature keeps things thoughtful instead of frantic.

Back in the game a few months later. Each battle is different without always leaning on gimmicks. The variation comes from layout and enemy composition. It reminds me of advice I once read about being a D&D GM: create an encounter, then preempt the first most obvious tactic the players would use. It forces second-order thinking without being obtuse. It’s still an incredible magic trick how the battles take place on the world map. Often when a new former-enemy joins my army after a battle, I’ll make a point of stationing them at the location where they were garrisoned during the battle. As my army, my classes, and my formations have expanded, it’s become very difficult to build hard-counter units. There are so many combinations of timing, synergy, and unit types that I am more often having to put a useful comp together for a unit and then throw it at an enemy. That sounds annoying non-deterministic but it hasn’t really been.

I keep coming back to this game night after night. Most nights I turn on my Switch and think “I might find something else to play tonight.” And I look over my backlog, and I end up going back to Unicorn Overlord. Many nights I’ll only get one battle done: an-hour long, crunchy tactical challenge. I don’t play for the leveling up even though those systems are intricate and expansive. I play for the joy of the challenge, the fun of putting together different units, and the consumption of the beautiful art and animations.

I am slowly getting broken of my fear to use consumables. This included the fear to use those stage points early in the game. They made the brilliant decision to cap those points at 10. That’s a nice number to bank, but it also means that if you’re making progress you’re going to hit the cap and lose them. This encourages you to spend them and gives a lot of variation to the stages. It’s impactful enough that I’ve tweaked unit comps just to have the right stage ability available.

Finished the game after 100 hours. I completed the story after about 95 and then spent about 5 more hours essentially doing nothing in the game because I couldn’t bear for it to be over yet. I completed every post-game challenge I could find. As far as I know, I 100%’d this game. I can not tell you the last time (any other time?) I’ve 100%’d a game. A very weird statement: 100 hours was the perfect length for this game.

As part of the final sequence the game again showed the world map as it would between chapters. As I listened to the final narration I looked over that map. I could point to specific places where I fought specific battles. All of that hinged on the incredible magic trick of fights happening directly on the same world map where you’d move around between battles.

Another incredible feat for a game with dozens of characters: I could tell nearly every character from their tiny sprite on the world map. Almost all of them had an identity that I could recall, and specific vocal ticks or timbres that I could hear in my head.

Playing on tactical difficulty, I felt sufficiently challenged without being stressed. On nearly every stage I was able to beat it on the first try but on some I’d have to pull out all of the stops with items and tactical thinking. The game continued to train me how to play more effectively up until the very final battle. Not only were the numbers going up making my characters stronger, but I was getting better as a tactician.

Yet still, even with that nicely stretched difficulty, I still felt that the game was a toybox and I was free to play with my toys. I could combine my action figures in all kinds of units and enjoy the way they worked together (or not!). Only at the very end did I get into truly optimizing multiple units. At that time I dug into every combination of moves, of prioritizing tactics to work the unit as a team, of carefully selecting gear for added skills and stat boosts and AP/PP upgrades. I found a way to use every character that I was interested in, sometimes building whole units around the concept of “by golly, I will have this guy in one of my endgame units, or die trying.”

The art and animation was stunning start to finish. Nearly every character was compelling while being just slightly over-the-top. The holistic effect was a grown-up storybook.

The last thing I did in the game was go to the tavern in hard-won Gran Corrine and share a meal between Alain, Scarlett, Lex, Chloe, and Josef. The original Liberation Army.
