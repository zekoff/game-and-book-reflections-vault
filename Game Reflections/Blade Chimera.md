The fast travel ability lets you immediately warp to any previously visited location immediately. Not just save points but from anywhere to anywhere. This is so transformative as to be almost an innovation in this genre. It means all forward progress is retained. It also eliminates the painful traversal over and over again of previous areas. A past time that often ends in the same dead end that you still don't have a solution for since the last time you tried. There are still game overs that knock you back to the last save. That's a misstep. It means that optimal play is one screen at a time pressing forward then warping to save, rinse and repeat. I'd never actually play like that but now it also means that if I ever lose progress it's double frustrating because I could always have just saved. 

Game looks 2D but is almost certainly built in a 3D engine. To be fair, [[Castlevania - Symphony of the Night|SotN]] looks the same way so I don't really know.

The most impactful feature is not really the sword. It’s a neat framing but it could be whatever spells or skills would show up in any game. The most impactful feature is probably the HP/MP regeneration system. Chained sword attacks recover HP and chained physical attacks recover MP. Creates an excellent resource management loop that lies on top of the standard action gameplay.

The action is responsive but measured. Just choose weapons that don’t require button mashing.
