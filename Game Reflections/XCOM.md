The tactics game that birthed the modern tactics genre. I'm sure it drew upon prior art but this was the smash success that blew the doors off tactics again. For the next decade or two you couldn't mention a tactics game without acknowledging how it stood in the shadow of XCOM to one degree or another. In that way it's not unlike [[Dark Souls]] -- a game so singular that all similar games would be measured against it.
