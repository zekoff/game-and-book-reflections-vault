One of the first true engine building games that I purchased and played. Takes a LONG time to play even with two players. Around 90 minutes or a little less.

My favorite thing about this game is that it's important for scoring to be a little bit of a generalist. There are several different aspects of a farm that are available and there's actually a penalty for any given aspect that you ignore.
