Beat on sixth run. Perhaps not quite as addictive as I thought it would be given the many early access previews and and full release reviews, but a very fun time and worth the price of admission. I could definitely tell my skill was growing each run. Several reviews I read said essentially that they’d failed to complete a single run after dozens of hours, but this wasn’t my experience -- and I beat a seventh run immediately after the sixth. From that point I wisely decided to broaden my playstyle and seek total maximums in case I had discovered a local maximum, so there’s probably still some game to unpack here. But even if there’s not, the game is fun and polished and I’d recommend it.
