Pleasantly short. Ends before it overstays its welcome. The game won’t win any awards or set the world on fire, but it has a neat core mechanic (the drill), an underused but fun secondary mechanic (the grappling hook), and an attractive art design. I won’t be 100%-ing this game, but it was worth the time I put into it.
