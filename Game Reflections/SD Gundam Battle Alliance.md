Played about half an hour. For some reason I expected a tactics game going in. I was surprised and pleased that this is a third person action game. The character moveset is a mix of ranged and melee attacks. The tutorial is heavy on the melee but from reading reviews it appears thay ranged can be a viable focus. Melee combos result in a combo meter, which is a feature I almost always find motivates me. I accidentally pulled off an un-tutorialized perfect guard and counter and this was the most fun moment of my playtime. Played long enough to get to the garage screen. Pilot XP and skills, Gundam upgrades and customization. Really more of a third person action RPG probably. Reviews say it's heavy on grinding and better with multiplayer. And limited presence from Gundam Wing series. All told, not for me, but I'm glad it exists and hope there's one for me later. Attacks and defends are more measured, enemies fewer but stronger, but otherwise broadly similar in structure to Musou games .

What would it take for it to be “for me ?” Less grinding. Punchier impacts and more combo variation. Probably a style other than SD. Less reliance on story or VN presentation. And more GWing presence as a bonus.
