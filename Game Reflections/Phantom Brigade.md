Played for a short time on Steam Deck. The small screen and mild bugginess didn’t help, but I was surprised how much I turned out to not be interested in this game. There’s no real hook in the thematic elements, art/sound design, or narrative. And, the system mixing thoughtful scripting with playback of realtime results didn’t resonate with me like I thought it would. It felt simultaneously too fiddly and too restrictive. I think having multiple mechs to script each turn was ultimately the right choice as it offers the capability to do the mech combat equivalent of “setting a pick” in basketball, and similar exercises. But it was difficult to reason about the way the system would work in advance. Given the cramped screen of the Steam Deck, I simply couldn’t overcome the learning curve to get into the game.
