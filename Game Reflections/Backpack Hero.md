It’s the sort of unattractive pixel art that I might create in my own hobby projects. Pixel art because it’s perceived as lowering the threshold of entry for creating art, rather than because it’s a stylistic choice that is to be executed with excellence.

The idea that “inventory [[Tetris]]” is a central game mechanic is a good one to explore. It is ripe with possibilities, and allows for a spectrum of play between “good enough” and “optimal” for the player to choose their own landing point. For as much space as “inventory tetris” takes up in the collective gamer psyche, the only examples of it I can think of offhand are the earlier [[Diablo]]s and [[Resident Evil 2]]. And in Diablo, even there it was comparatively unimportant as a mechanic thanks to the scroll of town portal -- more that it was mildly diverting of its own accord, than that it was a pillar upon which part of the game rests.

Because all inventory items are accessible on any combat turn, the only limiting resource is energy, and the only reactive gameplay is the visible intent of the enemy. I didn’t play enough to form a strong opinion about how this compares to the more traditional deck-builder, where the player’s options each turn are limited also by the cards that were drawn. I think based on my own experiments, there is probably space to explore here by removing part of the randomness (card draws) since there is a source of randomness still preserved (the enemy intents). My intuition is that it reduces the total spread of wackiness that the designer can explore in any single piece of gear, since that gear will be available every turn.

This game also suffered from a port which was clearly not designed with a controller in mind, and which suffered for it. There is some rudimentary concessions to not having a mouse cursor to move (face buttons that map directly to common commands, the right thumbstick as a free-moving mouse cursor fallback for when D-pad target snapping is insufficient), but it’s clunky. Actually, the UI design may be weaker than I’m even giving it credit for, through no fault of the controller UI. For example, there is a modal switch between viewing the map and viewing the backpack, but the modes are not strongly signalled outside of what component is taking up the center of the screen, and some of the quick-use buttons are available in other mode. My guess is that there are bugs here that would become evident with moderately-aggressive QA testing, and overall it tells me that they stopped at the point the prototype functioned, rather than iterating or having a clearer design vision.

It’s a hobby project scaled into a full release based on the strength of its central gimmick (inventory tetris) which, while somewhat compelling, is unlikely to stand up to scrutiny over many hours of play. On that note, I would be surprised if the design continues to hold up well. There is also a strategic layer of town building leading to power increases between runs, and my guess is that this is a crutch to smooth over a central tactical loop that is insufficiently polished.

Played again in late 2025. My thoughts have not evolved considerably. The concept of inventory Tetris is phenomenal. It’s wrapped in a game that is aesthetically dismal. The roguelike nature here also is used to hide kitchen-sink design. Simply throw up a bunch of options in every reward pool and push the care to the player instead of the designer. The most important thing is that the inventory packing is complicated primarily by keyword modifiers instead of item footprints. Many 1x1 items exist. Their various different modifiers create placement complexity. However, this buries the fun in parsing the individual item keywords and hovering over the dozens or different combinations of keywords. 1x1 items are very common. Instead, perhaps these 1x1 items should be rare specifically because their placement is so flexible. Finally, the combat is slavishly devoted to Slay the Spire. It is serviceable in that it prompts different reactions to different enemy compositions and states. It brings nothing new to the table, however.

Roguelite games can push a lot of the design work onto the player. Throw ingredients in. Then it becomes the player's job to pick the right perks in crafting a viable build. For balance, simply allow meta progression and then add difficulty switches at the top end. 

[[Hades]] is an example of a game which uses these as tools not crutches. Backpack Hero may be the opposite on at least element 1. For element 2 consider most action roguelites available today. 

You can probably tell by doing two things:

If you start a new file from scratch, is it possible to win a run with no metaprogression powers accumulated?

Is it possible to win runs consistently thus proving that builds are not entirely RNG dependent?
