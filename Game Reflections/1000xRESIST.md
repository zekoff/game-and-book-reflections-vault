I passed on this game after seeing it in the Nintendo eShop. It looked half-baked. Indeed, getting into the game, the movement is awkward, the character models are bad, the environments are stock Unity assets (or whatever engine), the voice acting is amateur. And yet… there had been a little buzz about it in the yearly rollup conversations and I took a chance. It’s interesting enough that I haven’t uninstalled it yet despite all that. I want to see what’s going on. This isn’t the kind of game I’d play normally but I’m going to keep giving it a shot.

What. a. TOWERING. Achievement.

Played nothing but this from start to finish. This is a Text. It calls to mind [[Infinite Jest]]. In its depth, in its support for close reading, in its surprise and bewilderment and yet by the end a closed loop where every important question is answered. And most of all in its exploration of generational sin.

It is clever but not self-consciously so. It presents its story with unblinking intensity and a clear vision. No hair is out of place. I have never been so propelled through a game whose unwavering focus is the story it tells.

The most impressive element of the script is the way it layers the same contours over and over to form a picture where every layer interprets the layer above and below. It loops back on itself from beginning to end. But every element of the story is also generous and self-contained. It doesn't withhold endings. It wraps up the Occupants, the generation ships of The 50, the Ancient Sister, the Watcher and her generation, the Jiaos, and Iris herself. Iris is masterfully painted as a character. She is imperfect but forgiveable. Her mother treats her poorly as she was treated poorly before Iris. Iris the young wounded mother passes that hurt to her children and they hurt her. All of the sisters really spring from one element or another of Iris. Which makes sense as they are clones.

Understanding of resistance. I got a cloudy glimpse into what might motivate people who resist oppression at great cost to themselves. It came not through the story of the Orchard but through the story of Mom and Dad and their resistance in Hong Kong.

Reflection on affirmative action. The Jiaos had been abused for decades and I had the chance to offer them reparation. The game didn't make me. And I knew that the current generation of Jiaos did not experience the first abuse. But it shaped their lives because it changed their course so many years ago. I loved the way the game allowed me to create my ending and simply told me what the result was. Not whether I was right or wrong.

The way it does this is place Blue in a small area with a streetlight shining on each of a few characters or groups representing a concept the game asked you to grapple with. You go to each group, Secretary shares a reflection on them, then you choose to turn their streetlight on or off. As an example, for the secret police the reflection is “a hammer when a hammer is needed, and when it is not.” Once you choose for everyone, Secretary will go around and describe the world you are choosing to preserve with these memories, and then release you into the world you've chosen. You then feel how you feel. The game doesn't give you further feedback on your choices.

There is so little gameplay and yet this couldn't have been done in any other medium. The light timeshifting puzzles made me go look for answers instead of presenting them to me fully formed. But it did allow me to get the answers instead of just hoping I would. That mechanic also meshes perfectly with the story. The past influences the future, the future can't be understood without the past, and we live in multiple times at once because of memory. The past and future actually shift as we live just not with the L and R buttons. The first person switches also were disorienting when they happened but then powerful. Who am I? I'm all of these characters. And none of them. The kick-to-menu moment breaking the fourth wall actually worked even though it shouldn't. It worked in two ways. First it drive home the magnitude of the murder of Iris and what a dramatic event that was. Second, the menu option became Start in red text. A new chapter in the story of the Orchard, propelling Principal (red) definitively to the fore. And yet start just as the first chapter had started.

The interaction is moving around first most often. Selecting dialogue options second. First in importance but second in button presses. Far, far behind those are the time shifting and warping mechanics. One of the few bobbles, maybe the only significant one I can think of, is that one of the final sequences of the game is a mechanical challenge combining movement and warping on a timer. I failed it my first try and thus got what I assume is the only possible non-diegetic game over. Even this they could have wrapped in a narrative conceit related to the communion, but they didn't. 

The voice acting and character models had a strange economy. They avoided the uncanny valley by erring on the abstract side of it. It worked so well that partway through the game I started to wonder if they were pulling a subtle magic trick by incrementally improving models, animations, and acting as the game progresses. They weren't. And that's a testament to how well the game worked the magic it does have. The creators had a game to make and they weren't going to let things like movie quality audiovisual expectations slow them down.

I watched the entire credits just to not have to leave yet. And because I wanted to see how many people worked on it and who. Not to wait for a stinger.

It's ultimately a game about memory. We carry incredible burdens from the past. But memories define us too. We must choose what to keep and what to release if we want to move forward. 

This work enriched my life.
