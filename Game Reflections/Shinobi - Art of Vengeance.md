Beautiful and stylish. This is a time in the medium where the 2D pixel throwback action game saturates digital storefronts. To see this painterly take on a retro game immediately causes it to stand out. The combat is fast but not quite frenetic. Combat follows the quick but steady mash-mash-dodge-mash-finisher cadence.

The combat has a more deliberate pace than I was expecting. Enemies telegraph their moves well ahead of time. A difficult encounter would have about three or four enemies onscreen and the challenge comes from managing their overlapping attacks.

Structurally the game is a blend of a standard stage-based action game and the backtracking of a Metroidvania. Even in the first stage there are obstacles that can’t yet be overcome and that signal you’ll be required to return later with an expanded moveset.

Each stage is distinct both in its aesthetic as well as usually having a minor unique gimmick, like plopping giant batteries into receptacles or riding wind currents. It continues to be beautiful and filled with care in its art.

The signature, almost-underutilized, feature of combat is the ability to stagger enemies and then execute them. Setting up a series of staggered enemies and then executing them all in one flurry is a reliable source of satisfaction. It’s also hard enough to do that it feels like a payoff. The use of the shuriken for building stagger gauge is a great way of weaving them into combat. I still remember the shuriken as the standout feature from the arcade cabinet version of Shinobi when I was a kid at the skating rink.

In the last boss fight the stage is a ruined cathedral with two stained glass panes still standing. One is a depiction of the final boss with his wife and holding their infant child. It’s looks peaceful and almost holy. The other is picture of only the boss holding his child with a red cast and a grim expression. This was the finest moment of storytelling in the game specifically because it was understated. It calls back to the opening image with Mushashi and his expectant wife. And it ties together the final moment where his student urges him to quell his spirit of vengeance and strike the final blow in a spirit of justice. It’s what actually breaks the cycle of revenge.
