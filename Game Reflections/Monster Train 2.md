After losing late in the tutorial run my initial opinion is that this is deeply similar to the original [[Monster Train]]. I expect to find much more variety alongside perfected balance and polish but I will be surprised to find anything dramatically changing the game. I’m actually a little disappointed. I’ll certainly be playing at least one more run though. I expect that the newness won’t reveal itself until I have more experience. I am a little shocked that I didn’t win the tutorial run. I was up to prestige level 21 or so in the original MT. Losing a run on base difficulty in MT2 wounded my pride a little.

I’ve now completed about five more runs plus a couple more failed runs. I’ve been almost begrudgingly compelled to keep playing. I look forward to unlocking the last couple of factions. Being able to pair two factions per run gives one of my favorite properties of games: adding another faction isn’t a linear increase in content but an exponential. Each faction you add gives another option to every other faction already in the game.
