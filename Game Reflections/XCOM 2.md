Improved upon the original in every way. Most important was the addition of mission timers. These were in direct response to disrupting the optimal play in XCOM -- moving one tile at a time until the next batch of enemies became exposed. The timer forces risk taking.

Very successful in the player's head. It's natural to form strong attachments to certain squaddies and feel the pain of loss or the celebration of saving them.
