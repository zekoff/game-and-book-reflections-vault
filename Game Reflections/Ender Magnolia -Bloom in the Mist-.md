Competent metroidvania. The methodical combat leaves little room for error. There are generous and well-signaled wind-up times and tells for almost every enemy. Bosses are difficult but of the four or five I fought they never felt cheap. The mix and match weapons worked well. All of the combinations and weapons I experimented with seemed viable. Some were my very clear favorites but I was able to see the purpose and niche for each of them. Traversal is mundane and slow. Double-jump, dash, and an anemic sprint are the place where a Metroidvania should start the player from at this case. These were all unlocks from fighting bosses. That not only failed to build momentum, it actually sapped momentum. I looked it up online and there are some possibly more interesting things down the line but nothing that stood out to me as special or game-defining.

That’s the theme of this game overall. Nothing about it caught me as special. The idea of “homunculi” fighting on your behalf as you free them is an interesting framework. The problem is that the game works so hard to obscure the lore that it’s difficult to buy in. There is either a lot of prior knowledge required to pick up on the sparse tidbits, or the game is deliberately withholding information in hopes that it’s tantalizing, but either way it didn’t work for me.
