Played the demo for maybe half an hour. The dash move wreathed the character in swooping black strokes and particles. It tickled my memory but I couldn’t put my finger on why until I slashed downward at an enemy from the air and I bounced up. [[Hollow Knight]].

The game is well-produced and character control feels polished. It should find an audience if there’s any justice. It’s not for me though. The artistic direction is gruesome. A disgusting mix of skulls, flesh, and cosmic horror.
