Joyful and childlike. I can’t imagine its like being made today. It is jubilant in its weirdness without a hint of cynicism. Never once winks at the camera, despite how weird it is.

Timed-action button press battle system really holds up. This is the first I remember of this style, and makes a case for being still the best. Actually shows how poorly [[Sea of Stars]] did this battle system, despite being many years later with a talented development team.

Why does Mario doff his cap instead of give the peace sign?!
