The twee graphics are too much. I was too off-put to sink my teeth into any of the gameplay. I was hoping that I could use this game to leverage a system I understand ([[Tetris]]) to scaffold me into learning the depth of a system I don’t understand ([[PuyoPuyo]], which is like [[Dr. Mario]] if the pills were detached at the halfway point). But I can’t deal with the characters.
