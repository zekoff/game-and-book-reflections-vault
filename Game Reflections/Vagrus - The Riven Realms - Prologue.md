Text-heavy resource management. This plays as I’ve always heard [[King of Dragon Pass]] described. The interface is difficult to manage on the Switch. I’d otherwise be likely to spend more time in this game. The worldbuilding is highly effective and done through only pictures and text.

I enjoyed the story vignettes most. The systemic elements of the game are not to my taste. The game is tuned to be VERY difficult. I nearly had a total party wipe in the second tutorial battle. Not only did I feel incompetent, I saw no path towards competence.
