Suspiciously similar to [[TownsFolk]]. This is either an astonishing example of convergent evolution, or one was modeled after the other.

Uses a cardinal-direction adjacency system. I am coming to prefer hex tiles when implementing adjacency bonuses. There is more flexibility since each tile can have six adjacency spots instead of four.

One thing about both this game and TownsFolk is that once you have reached a stable state with resources, you often just need to advance turns over and over until you can continue towards whatever objective you are seeking. The only dynamism is some scattered random events upon tile revelation or occasionally upon the tick to a new day. There is extreme tension in placing things during the early game, then boredom in the late game. It’s the reverse of what an engagement curve should be. The early game should allow for a couple of easy decisions and a little time to come to grips with whatever the start condition is. The late game should ratchet up the tension so that the end presents a final exam. Here the early game presents ample opportunity for an unrecoverable death spiral. TownsFolk does maintain a little more tension till the end on stages where there are barbarians but these are so overpowered as to be dejecting.

I’m having the same reaction to this game that I had to TownsFolk. It is something I should like on paper yet I’m ending up in a state of revulsion for it. They are thematically similar in that they are generic Eurogame pastoral. TownsFolk is a little more grim or world-weary, while Dawnfolk is more twee. The tone is almost entirely due to the narrator in each. TownsFolk has a hooded figure who speaks cryptically about a faraway crown who is bent towards injustice. Nods towards nihilism, “where is the meaning in all this?” Dawnfolk has an anthropomorphic candle flame with amnesia. The opening stages are filled with “I am convinced we should build and don’t know why but let’s do it!” A couple of stages into the story mode it turns out he represents the “life of the planet” or something. It’s unclear who the narrators are talking to. The player directly? Fourth-wall breaking without leaning into that choice. Is your avatar a kingdom administrator? If so why do you have no agency of your own?

Opening splash screen with a pixelated portrait of the developer saying something pitiful like “I worked so hard on this game and I hope you love it!”. That opening is certain to do nothing but diminish my changes of loving the game. It’s the same thing that [[Forager]] did. Even the little plopping sound effects on the main menu are similar to Forager.
