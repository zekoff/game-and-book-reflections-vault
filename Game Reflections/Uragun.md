Twin-stick shooter roguelike. Approachable artistic design. Cartoony robot and AI companion with some erstwhile buddy chemistry. Nods toward an AI run amok as the threat. The game is competent, and I mean that as a compliment. It isn’t dumbed down either. There are enough abilities to require a gamepad. Control is smooth and there is attention to detail like how much enemy knockback occurs upon striking them and how they flock together while staying out of one anothers’ physics bodies. Levels are objective-based rather than straight arenas. Often an area will lock down until you’ve defeated a number of waves. Riffing on that though are complications. Terrain features like chasms and obstacles change how you move and fight. Jump pads will send you to other nearby areas. There are occasionally points to defend or bonuses earned by a short king-of-the-hill side objective. Ultimately it’s all moving and shooting, but isn’t that every game? It’s well put together and reasonably varied (given my total playtime of only a couple of hours at least).

I won’t be playing further though because I don’t see the framework of anything that would make it special. Every single element is well crafted on its own. It’s absolutely the sum of its parts. But not greater. Geoff Englestein would say that it’s lacking “one new thing.” It’s increasingly not enough for a game to be solid. A game must also be special. It’s a shame because I’d be proud of having made this game. And the feature list is everything I might include. If this were released at the beginning of the XBLA cycle (or even the early Switch eShop) it would have sold gangbusters. It was absolutely worth the money though. $4 on sale.

For a game that is “solid and also special” I can point to the many hours I’ve spent playing [[Jupiter Hell]] lately. I’m glad I gave that game a second try. It’s immaculately crafted but its “one new thing” is the focus on ranged combat.
