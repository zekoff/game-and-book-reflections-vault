Holds up surprisingly well. Dungeon progression involves a significant element of puzzle solving. None of the puzzles are necessarily brain-burners but there have already been a couple that stumped me for a moment. It’s been fun to just sit there and figure things out myself. Possible solutions are constrained enough that I know I’ll be able to figure it out if I just fiddle enough.

There’s also enough complexity in the RPG systems that today it would have tutorials. But there are no tutorials. Very little help text even. And… it’s refreshing. I have to learn by playing around with things. Yet the game is still polished. It has little hidden playability concessions like hotkeys to perform common actions. This is interesting and I wonder if it’s a product of its time. Late 2001 -- perhaps when games were mature enough to understand UX but not so over-produced as to have all rough edges sanded away in pursuit of frictionless experience. Nowadays it seems developers lean hard into one or the other as a badge of honor either way. “Tutorials” were still called “instruction manuals” during this time. This was probably near the tail end of the instruction manual era but as this was a GBA game it surely had one.

The writing is straightforward and sound. And I love that an early ability is “Mind Read” and can be performed on any NPC. They each have something extra to say. This reminds me of [[Octopath Traveler]]'s action where each NPC has a little extra backstory if you check on them. Enriches the world quite a bit.

I accidentally sequence broke and progressed to the third major area before the second. Part of that was me following breadcrumbs instead of rinsing the town I was in. But the game allowed me to do it by simply powering through an area that I now realize was too hard for me. I respect the game for allowing it. When I returned to the previous area it even honored in dialogue the fact that I had a new party member I shouldn't have had. The battles were fun because they were too hard and I didn't realize it. I had to use every tool in my toolkit and it made me appreciate all the different spells and recovery options I had available. 

There's a little bit of Adventure genre in here. Pay attention to what people say and then bring the right item from there to here and use it on the thing. 

PP regenerates itself when walking in areas where random encounters can occur. The cycle of releasing djinni, summoning them, and setting them. Class system based on which djinni are equipped. 

I stopped after reaching the city of Tolbi. This is the city containing the mini games and the “Colosso” event which was actually very clever. Issac is selected to run through a puzzle-solving gauntlet prior to each coliseum match. You may also place your other party members in the crowd close enough to use their synergy, solve or ease the puzzles along the way, and thus speed Issac along to the podium where the fight will take place and which has two items of which you can select the better one if you arrive first. This sequence really captures almost everything that is special about Golden Sun. It combines the puzzle solving, the in-world Psynergy use, and the combat.

At this point I felt I had seen everything the game had to show me from a mechanical perspective. I knew from reading a walkthrough that I still had between 1/4 and 1/3 of the game left. The story is fine but I decided to move on rather than see things through in what risked becoming a grind at this point.
