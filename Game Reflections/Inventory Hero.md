Quality Playdate game. Fits the Playdate aesthetic even without use of the crank. The main character’s sprite is well-drawn with cartoon proportions. Various bits and bobs appear while fighting enemies. These bits and bobs are a random selection of objects and some of them interact with each other. Rabbits quickly multiply to fill up your inventory if there are two of them. Mushrooms grow rampantly to bump out other objects you are holding. The equipment you can use is also an eclectic selection. You can be wielding an axe, wearing a doctor mask as a helmet, and holding an old tire as shield.

The gameplay is not quite an auto-battler. You have six inventory slots, and your only interaction with the game is by discarding something in a slot or using it. Many objects get equipped to various slots and boost attack or defense. Some come with playing card suits, and you can stack equipment of the same suit, but it’s not clear what benefit this has.

It does get a little frantic for my taste in later levels. I feel like I’m just barely quick enough to press buttons with the necessary speed to keep the inventory moving. I don’t like how this makes it a twitch game, but it does have the gameplay effect of preventing you from thoroughly considering your options, and this adds welcome chaos. I wonder what the game would be like if they slowed things down a bit. To keep that chaos, you could perhaps increase the total number of inventory items that need to be considered. That would present a UI problem though on the limited real estate of the Playdate screen. So here is probably a game that honors the platform’s constraints. Cuts with the grain of the wood instead of against it. This might ultimately be why it feels like the game is of fine craftsmanship.
