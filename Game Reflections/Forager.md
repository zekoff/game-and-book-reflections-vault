Addictive to the point that I drove myself near to illness during a multi-hour play session. This is the type of game that I had to uninstall to save myself. The bubbly tweens and popping sounds are one of the hallmarks of this game. That aesthetic has been repeated dozens of times since then.

One of my strongest memories of this game is an intro splash screen with a message from the developer that says something like "I worked really hard on this game! I hope you like it!" It makes me cringe to the point of physical cramps. I also recall that the game contains an unlockable comic book detailing the developer's arduous journey to bring the game to life. I deeply hate it.

This game is like [[Obelisk Miner]] or [[Farm RPG]] in that I played it compulsively until one moment when I suddenly hated it with every fiber of my being and rage-uninstalled it.
