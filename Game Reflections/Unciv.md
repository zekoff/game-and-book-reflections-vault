An open source reimplementation of [[Civilization 5]]. It also includes a modding engine that can change the game quite drastically if desired. I played this probably years ago but the fold-open Pixel 9 Pro Fold has given it a new life for me. It’s been a surprisingly good Civ experience now that I’ve tweaked the UI. I’d go so far as to say it’s essentially mobile Civ 5.

This is an example of why the Switch and a phone can be such good game platforms. If the console supports quick-resume, it makes it pleasant to dip into and out of a full-fat game with only a few minutes to spend on it.

Now in late 2025 I’ve come back to this game. I’ve played a couple of games to completion recently. Astonishing in and of itself, as in the words of Dirk Kniemeier, I start way more games of Civ than I finish. It’s frictionless and for the first time in my long (calendar-time and game-time) history with this franchise I am deeply understanding and appreciating the mechanics needed to play at a higher level. I’ve only ever really played as a carebear turtle. I knock out my first cities until there's no room and then spend the rest of the game building them up and throwing gold at other civs to leave me alone. Now for the first time I have said something very close to “alright then Denmark -- you merely adopted this war, but I was born for it.” I haven’t suddenly become a hex wargamer. I just now appreciate how things like correctly building armies wins 90% of the battle. And to build that army you need to know why you shouldn’t build that Barracks unless you actually know you want it. I’m starting to appreciate the push and pull of the different “buckets” as Sid calls them. Research paces most things yet is useless on its own. I may want Culture in this city not because I’m seeking a particular policy but because I need the rapid border expansion. I needed the rapid expansion because I had too many Grasslands tiles and not enough Plans Hill tiles so I need to open up some production tiles and get the city economy going. I might want Faith for a religious victory but I also might want to convert cities because I’m attempting to optimize my religion’s Enhancer bonus. That Gold pooling in my coffers is an embarrassment because it means I ground away somewhere I didn’t need to or I missed a stroke somewhere. That I’ll need to rush Happiness buildings because I knowingly overextended myself in a land grab that I hoped would pay off later.

The Civ V implementation may be the closest thing we have to “Mere Civilization.” All of the pieces we need are there and there really aren’t pieces you can afford to lose and it still be Civ. It’s probably a good control subject for examination of why Civ VII works so much less well for me than I expected.
