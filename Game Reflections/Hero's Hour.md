This is another game that I feel may have been influenced directly or indirectly by the [[Dominions 5 - Warriors of the Faith|Dominions]] franchise. It has a bewildering number of classes and races, a clear separation the between turn-based strategic map versus abstract realtime battlefields, and a “who gives a damn” visual style. It’s one of those games that work the way I once heard Endless Legend described: I’m not sure if it’s actually good, but it sure is interesting. ([[Endless Legend]]] is actually good; the comment by the critic was uncharitable.)

I’ve come back to this game and put another 10-15 hours into it, completing 6-8 campaigns. Perhaps this game is, in fact, good as well as being interesting. The variety in the factions impresses me. They all ultimately depend on building up cities and moving around armies full of unit stacks. The way those cities are built and armies are composed is usually quite distinct however. Each faction has a completely different suite of units, heroes, and buildings. The buildings and the hero skills are not palette swaps. They dramatically change the way you approach each game. Each faction also has some sorts of significant tweaks in how they interact with the map.

Combat does strike a pretty sweet spot. It’s mostly just letting units crash into each other. There are times though where it’s helpful to take care in unit selection and placement and counter a specific threat. Similarly, there are occasions where directing a unit is helpful, but mostly it’s the pleasure of watching an ant farm.

Enemy AI is ineffective at using the map the way a player does, but enemy armies are still generally well-stocked and thus present a threat simply through combat.
