Many of the games have a touch of the [[Spelunky]] in that they are full of secrets and subtle signals about how to play. Campanella 2 is a great example of this. It seems brutally hard at first. (And it it, but that’s neither here nor there.) Then I zoomed out a little intellectually and realized “hey, the levels are procedurally generated. Hey, I can make decisions to get stronger across different paths during the game. Hey, little mistakes are quickly punished with permadeath.” It’s a modern roguelike.

It’s impressive that none of the games are throwaway. Each one I’ve played has things to learn which aren’t necessarily tutorialized but that are reasonably meaty. I haven’t played even half of the games yet and feel very satisfied already. There’s no telling what else I’ll find. In that way it’s not dissimilar from Playdate Seasons 1 and 2.

I am just shy of the true 80s audience for which this game would be a transportive experience. But I’m not so far outside of it that I can’t appreciate it.
