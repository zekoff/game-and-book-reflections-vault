No traditional combat. This separates it from the infinite other Metroidvanias available on Switch. I thought I would like this more than I do. The tradeoff is that it completely removes a potential progression system from the game. There are still significant abilities to unlock, but not that many, and they're quite tame. A jetpack, a flashlight.

I loved filling out the compendium by taking photographs. For each enemy, making more compendium entries by capturing their AI states not only unlocks more information about them, but also extends the time they are stunned after taking a picture. I've always liked this oddly specific system where compiling more information leads to mechanical advantages.

I deleted the game after becoming stuck and frustrated. One of the problems with this genre is that, if locks and keys aren't carefully telegraphed, it's easy to end up wandering, uncertain if you missed something or accidentally did a sequence break. I ran into this same problem recently in [[Animal Well]].

This game has made me reflect on the actually significant differences between [[Metroid series|Metroid]] and [[Castlevania series|Castlevania]]. Post-[[Castlevania - Symphony of the Night|SotN]] Castlevania has the significant difference that it has a leveling system. Backtracking means that you run into enemies again. These are additional opportunities for leveling and thus progressing. When you return to an area that you struggled with hours ago and this time mow through the same enemies like a buzzsaw, you see how far you've come. It recontextualizes the same place, in the same way that new abilities recontextualize the map. Locks and keys. Castlevania also has a blessed fast travel system. It's hard to live without that now. The Prince of Persia reboot implemented the photo feature to remind yourself of what locks were where. Better than a map pin system. And that game also telegraphed its locks more clearly.
