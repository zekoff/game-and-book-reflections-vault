There are two defining mechanical features.

- Turns are real-time. There is a short timer in which you must play a card on your turn. Every card you play adds some time back to the timer. Furthermore, the minions and towers you spawn are simulated in realtime. They will continue fighting regardless of card play pace. This does give one interesting dynamic where if you are pushing forward, you may play your cards more slowly, in order to milk the timer and press your advantage.
- There is a large element of tower defense. You can place cards at certain locations and some of the cards are actually towers. They will continually fire on the enemy, or taunt them, or attack the other leader. This pairs well with the slow attack from minions who have also been played. Heavier emphasis on indirect attacking. You field an army but they do most of the attacking unless you lean into the direct spell types.

There are a couple of other tweaks on the Spire-like formula. First, the card play resource is actually the number of cards in your hand. A turn ends when you have two cards left in hand. This makes card draw disproportionately powerful. Not only do you get more options, but you get more plays as well. Second, the overall stage is progressed through a map made of tiles. You can advance to the tile directly ahead or to a diagonal up tile. Ultimately this is a similar underlying model to Spire, but there are more options for choosing different courses. Slay the Spire offers only a few points per stage that allow you to pick a branch. OverDungon offers nearly constant opportunity to change your path.

The game self-describing as having a “meme aesthetic”. Disproportionate number of llamas present in this game. Overall this decision means there’s little cohesion. Just a collection of random things bashing into each other.

In this switch port there are giant empty spaces to the right and left. The game seems to have been designed for a vertical mobile aspect. It makes things hard to see and hard to control. This contributes to the overall feeling that the game is mostly random. I pick cards that generally fit together (all animals, throw in some towers, etc.) but generally I just throw them out and hope for the best. It’s not a particularly tactical game.
