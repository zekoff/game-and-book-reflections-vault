Played an hour of the demo. Neat concept and likely a solid game conversion of a simulation. I get “train game” vibes from it -- it probably appeals strongly to a person fascinated with airplanes. They'd appreciate many details that I see but that don't resonate with me. This game is a good example of theme tutorializing a game (or not). I have no mental model of how air traffic control should work thematically, so I'm left at the mercy of a tutorial on the mechanics and input requirements. That will teach me what buttons to press but it doesn’t teach the higher-level concepts like what to prioritize and where the friction of gameplay will be found. I might eventually learn something but I'll struggle to internalize it and never really get to the point it's second nature. So the game isn't for me through no fault of its own.
