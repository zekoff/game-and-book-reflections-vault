Was looking for a [[Factorio]]-like to use with my new phone in tablet mode. This certainly answers the mail. I actually like the control method more than Factorio. In Factorio your avatar is an engineer unit that you control directly. Here, your avatar is a hovercraft-y thing that moves wherever you scroll the screen to. This makes intuitive UI sense. You’re only ever going to be acting on things in your field of view, so it makes sense to tie it to map scrolling. I also appreciate that resource deposits are ever exhausted. Factorio does tickle my consumable phobia to some degree and always feels a little uncomfortable. I know that no matter how perfect my assembly line is, there’s always an end to it somewhere down the road.
