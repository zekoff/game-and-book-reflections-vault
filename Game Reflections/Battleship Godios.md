Mashup of [[Breakout]] and [[Gradius]]. Poor graphics even for Playdate. Requires some twitch control with that sorry Playdate D-pad. The one thing that elevates it is the (un-tutorialized) use of the crank to go back in time at will. This is probably the most powerful use of the crank in the games on Playdate. It’s the same single mechanism as the whole of Crankin’s Time Travel Adventure. The stage where I quit (the sixth or so?) is where an enemy battleship begins made of invisible bricks that only show up when you strike them for the first time. By that point in the game your lives have probably been whittled down and it requires more memorization than is reasonable so many levels deep. There certainly was a puzzle element as enemy movement is deterministic and you get better at early stages. Of all the Playdate games, this one made my hand cramp the most.
