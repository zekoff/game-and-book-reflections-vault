2D action platformer roguelike. I am not sure what the team was trying to accomplish with this game. After a couple of hours there don’t appear to be any mechanical or thematic innovations. I’m particularly underwhelmed by the gameplay. Combat is imprecise and repetitive. Enemies are threats due to their high damage but can simultaneously be trivialized by baiting them into their static animations and then moving behind them to strike. Death comes only when several enemies are located together and spaced so that they can’t all be trivialized but neither does the player have any other tools for dealing with them.

Jumping in the game is comically bad. If I stand under the same ledge in the same place and jump ten times, half will produce successful mantling to the top through what appears to be a graphical glitch, and the other half will produce just a jump and a return to starting location. I’m very curious about the development of this game. Perhaps it’s better on PC but the console version is Switch exclusive. Another baffling decision since its technical performance on Switch is poor.
