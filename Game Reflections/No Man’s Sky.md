I love games with "magic tricks". The magic trick of this game is the way you can seamlessly fly down to the surface of a planet from space.

The procedural generation had the [oatmeal problem](https://www.google.com/search?q=oatmeal+problem+in+game+design+for+procedural+content&rlz=1CAANLP_enUS1116US1116&oq=oatmeal+problem+in+game+design+for+procedural+content&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCTEwNzI3ajBqOagCALACAQ&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) when the game first released. However, it seems to have gotten better since then. The developers have also stapled on system after system to expand the universe. An impressive game. The sort of thing I dreamed of making as a youth.
