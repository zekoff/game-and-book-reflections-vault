Demo version. The story was at least mildly diverting in the beginning. I sat through the voiced in-engine cutscenes and soaked in the world. Calvard is a generally modern-day setting that appears to combine elements of England and Japan. One of the dual protagonists is introduced as a combat version of a hard-boiled detective but with a heart of gold as he tends to a child and then is alternately mothered by her. The second of the dual protagonists appears to be a straight laced gal who will bend the law to serve a greater good. Compelling so far. It's when they meet that things start to sour a little. Van appraises Agnes as having something along the lines of “the appearance of a grown woman with the carriage of a schoolgirl” as the camera pans across the character’s improbably-portioned anatomy while she blushes. She is confirmed to be, indeed, school age. Creepy for both the characters and the player. This is all part of the intro sequence which lasts upwards of half an hour before the game turns control over to the player in any way. There's a thirty-foot walk to an area boundary before control is removed again for the next story sequence. At this point I started skipping the cutscenes just so I could get to try the combat. 

The combat system is fabulous. You can directly attack enemies in the world in a light version of an action RPG, then switch to the meatier turn based mode at any time. Turn based is the primary combat system but this approach milks some gameplay out of otherwise trivial opponents. 

The main combat system has fluid positioning which is fun on both offense and defense. Offensively you can line up special attacks, and defensively you can avoid telegraphed special attacks. There are basic attacks, readily accessible special attacks, and resource limited magic attacks. Attacks are flashy and satisfying. There is a bewildering array of status effects, damage types, resistance and weaknesses, and other complicated but delightful RPG nonsense to build around and exploit. This is also a game with a shared and manipulable action order between player party and enemies. I didn't even see every system during the tutorial either. 

The UI is a shame. It's well thought out and confidently assembled. There are slick transitions and nice usability touches like direct button presses for different selection actions. However, it's also a grainy and tiny mess on the 720p Switch handheld screen. Much of the interface is difficult or impossible to see even when holding the screen close and squinting.

The last experience I had with the game was advancing through some dialogue between the protagonists during the intro dungeon. It was setting the stage for these new characters but it was relatively soulless. Both characters fall just on the side of caricature and superficiality. As much as I want to finally sink my teeth into the Trails series, I'm not seeing a game here that I'll hang with for a hundred hours to see it through.
