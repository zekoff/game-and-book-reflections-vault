Not often I play a new battle system in a turn based game, but I think I can fairly say that this is new. The dice aren't even the most interesting mechanism. It's the ability to control when the enemy plays what. I read a review that described the game as “on the easy end” of the spectrum. I indeed beat the game on my first run. I do think I'll come back for more though. The unlocks were generous. The game also wisely showed me a locked door at the end. Of the four glyphs that presumably will unlock a greater challenge, my run completion only activated one of them. 

The play is snappy. This is incredibly important for a turn based game. The little monsters are cute. They each have a single trait which does enable memorization. It also calls to mind [[Siralim]], the worst game I've ever invested 500 hours in. There is just enough complexity in a party composition that I'd be afraid to walk away more than a day from a game.
