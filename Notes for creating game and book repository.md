Template should include a property with just game name (so it's not just in the file name which is metadata)
Include date the entry is created
When importing existing reflections just set date to Jan 1 of the year they were logged
Copy-paste and go through entries individually in order to link notes together
Include a genre property, list type
Include which platform it was played on
Include a characteristics list, like "Pixel", "Systemic", "Linear"
Create folder at root of Google Drive for "Game Reflections"
Nest reflections for individual games in a "Games" folder of the vault
Create Bases, etc. at the root of the Vault
Other analysis notes at the root of the vault

**Biggest thing is *linking* the games.**


Create one template specially for importing where the date is not set automatically? Or just manually override it upon import

Need a checklist for knowing which each game has been imported
Include a checkbox for "Recommended"?

Add heading for "Reflection"
Add heading for "Brief Description of Gameplay"

Some way to add a scale for enjoyment?
