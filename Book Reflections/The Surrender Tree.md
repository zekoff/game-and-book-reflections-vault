Something I’d never have read if left to my own devices, but Emma Cate asked me to read it. It’s the story of attempted Cuban revolution from the Spanish. It’s told in the form of short rhymeless poems from the perspective of several different narrators. Most poems are a freeze-frame in the character’s thinking as they reflect on something happening around them or to them. The end is poignant as the Americans take political control over Cuba from the Spanish which undermines the entire Cuban resistance movement. Despite the ultimate futility of the revolution, the actions of the characters are not meaningless. One of the central figures is a military nurse named Rosa. She is known for treating Spanish and Cuban alike despite the Spanish attempt to quell the rebellion. The people she saved live on and this weaves the theme into something different but more powerful than the story I’d have expected.
