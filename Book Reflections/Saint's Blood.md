A partial return to the feeling of [[The Princess Bride]] from the first novel. Quips are more free-flowing and there are additional callbacks to the script/book. Brasti butchers a word and Kest remarks “I don’t think that’s the word you mean.” Later Brasti will even say “inconceivable.” Kest trained with his left hand to keep himself challenged.

At the same time, the book doesn’t backtrack from its darker moments in book 2. The stakes are high and the characters are flawed. But this lends a gravitas to the exploration of Valour. From the dark night of the soul comes the first rays of daybreak. “I am the friend in the dark hour.”

A gut-wrenching moment: Tommer, the child and aspirational Greatcoat, lies dying after defending his sister’s honor. He looks up at Falcio expectantly. And Falcio initiates him with the words “Report, Greatcoat.”
