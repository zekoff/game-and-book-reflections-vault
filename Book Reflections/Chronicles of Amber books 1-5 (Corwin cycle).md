“Youth, love, beauty… I knew them in Avalon. Proud steeds, bright metal, soft lips, dark ale.” That’s a book-validating turn of phrase! Page-turning for five books in a row. They all flow together as a single story that feels of a piece since book 1. It’s amazing how there are so many Amberite siblings and almost all of them have memorable identities. Corwin, Bleys, Julian, Caine, Gerard, Benedict, Flora, Fiona, Lewella, Eric, Brand, Random. I remember all of those off the top of my head. There is one more sister with whom Corwin has strange incestuous thoughts about whose name escapes me. (Looked it up -- Deirdre.) One of the things I appreciate is how the books expand as they go but still feel like the system was always there from the beginning.

Tir Na’nog (close?) is a neat concept. An ethereal city in the sky given form by moonlight and carries an dream-like atmosphere.

Much surrounds the concept of the Pattern, a magical inscription of curves that Amberites must walk to inherit their power. Also the Trumps: Tarot cards featuring Oberon’s children by which they can communicate and travel to one another.

Shadow walking is also neat. The Amberites combine physical movement with a will to shape their surroundings and by this means can travel to alternate universes.

“And he did that thing.”
