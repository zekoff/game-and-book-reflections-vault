I read this (or at least some of it) as a child. At that time I must not have appreciated the Arthurian component of the story. It’s been a fairly quick read. Nearing the end now, and there is still some mystery surrounding Great Uncle Merry and the Vicar. This ultimately falls into children’s literature because of the thin logic that compels the children to pursue the quest on their own. The parents trust them alone in a strange house and so depart (the day after the home being burgled), the mystery guardian is under oath somehow to not assist them directly, and in addition he’s bamboozled by a minor character into abandoning the children in their hour of need.

I initially assumed that Cooper was a Christian and that the book was written in the Christian tradition. I believe I may have even run into these stories may years ago in a Christian bookstore or a church library. However, she is apparently agnostic or atheist. There has been some paper written that contrasts her spirituality with Tolkien’s and Lewis’.

It’s hinted (strongly) in the epilogue to the book that Great Uncle Merry is actually Merlin. Seeing this, I went to the Wikipedia page for the series and spoiled everything for myself. The Light is a force for human agency and the Dark is a force for chaos and tyranny. The rest of the books cover a more openly-magical conflict that leads to an ultimate resolution. The books continue to be children’s books and won several awards including Newberry Medals. I think I’d have liked them fine enough, but I don’t regret moving on.
