The blossoming of Jack’s evil is horrifying. The scene in which he consummates his vengeance with Evene is sickening (as intended). It’s the moment he transitions from a vengeful spirit into a truly irredeemable character. The various settings are each memorable for their own sake as well as for the plot beats that happen in each. The Lord of Bat’s place of power, the lightside university, the Great Machine in the center of the earth and the path to get there, the ravenous stone upon which Jack feeds. The way that Jack uses the scientific power of the university mainframe to unlock the sorcerous power of the Key of Kolwynia is brilliantly unexplained. As I reflect, the story is about not just the plot, but about the utter ruin to which a man is driven by his own power.

One memorable line “Jack continued to resolve border disputes to his satisfaction.” And something like “it was done just as he said.”
