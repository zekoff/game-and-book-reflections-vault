Has a strong sense of place and time, and I’m curious if Cather was herself a Catholic since the book draws deeply from Catholic imagery. Bishop Latour is almost a study in negative space. We learn more about him from the way that characters respond to him, than any particular insight into his thoughts or even direct dialogue with him. He’s certainly not a completely opaque character -- he will talk opening with Valliant and other characters. But his characterization comes more from seeing the effect he has on the world around him.

“We build for the future--better not lay a stone unless we can do that.”

“I will go at once, Father. But you should not be discouraged; one does not die of a cold.” The old man smiled. “I shall not die of a cold, my son. I shall die of having lived.”

“Men travel faster now, but I do not know if they go to better things.” “We must not try to know the future, Eusabio. It is better not.”

“As a priest, the bishop knew that it was indiscreet to consent to a meeting with this outlawed chief; but he was a man, too, and a lover of justice. The request came to him in such a way that he could not refuse it.”
