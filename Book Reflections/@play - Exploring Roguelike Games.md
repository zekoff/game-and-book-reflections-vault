Interesting light read that gave provocation to thoughts about game design, although most of this book is an examination of different roguelikes and features of their design, rather than rationale behind their design or the impact of their design decisions on the player. Reminder that the major classical roguelikes include [[ADOM]], [[Nethack]], and suddenly I can’t remember the others (DCSS was not considered a major classical roguelike at the time this collection of essays was being written). Also investigates the Shiren / Mystery Dungeon games pretty heavily.

Also references [[Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup]], [[Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island]] as a stand-in for the Shiren series
