Over the years I’ve gotten the idea that Macdonald, and Phatastes in particular, has influenced Lewis or Tolkien or both. A fifth of the way in so far, I recognize how it might have been an influence. It’s a “fairy story” in the sense of the essay Tolkien wrote on them.

I also notice in the cadence of writing some similarities with [[House on the Borderlands]]. A writing style that seems… immature? for lack of a more precise term. But perhaps it’s me that’s immature or uncouth. Perhaps this a British style or a product of the era. Phantastes was apparently written in the mid-1800s, and I don’t know when House on the Borderlands was written (though I think it was substantially later).

Came across a couple of memorably horrifying images. The tree-bride with an enchanting beauty who only faced forward. Who lulled the traveler to sleep in her lap, faint rose light playing across her alabaster skin, but with the red tinge highlighted strangely in her eyes before he drifted off to sleep. Revealed in the morning to be a creature of deadwood hollowness throughout when looked at from any other angle, the beautiful form only seen as she carefully presented one side of herself. Then, the ogre-witch who warned the traveler not to open the door. When he did, it was a gate to outer darkness, and she recited a poem about how light is merely a tiny cave in the infinite mine of darkness, before the traveler’s shadow took form from the outer darkness and began to follow him.

“So, then, as darkness had no beginning, neither will it ever have an end. So, then, it is eternal. The negation of aught else, is its affirmation. Where the light cannot come, there abideth the darkness. The light doth but hollow a mine out of the infinite extension of the darkness. And ever upon the steps of the light treadeth the darkness; yea, springeth in fountains and wells amidst it, from the secret channels of its mighty sea. Truly, man is but a passing flame, moving unquietly amid the surrounding rest of tonight; without which he yet could not be, and whereof he is in part compounded.” The ogre-witch reading from her little book by the light of a small red flame.

“All mirrors are magic mirrors.” Macdonald on the thought that reflections are “lovelier” than the true image. In my mind, perhaps this is true because the reflection forces us to see something that’s truly there but in a way we must process differently, and so we perceive more of its truth rather than the first image we process through our eyes.

“He persuaded himself that if he but knew the worst he would be satisfied; for then he could… find that relief in constant motion, which is the hope of all active minds when invaded by distress.”

“The veil between, though very dark, is very thin.” Anodos, in the tomb of his ancestors.

“I learned that he that will be a hero, will barely be a man; that he that will be nothing but a doer of his work, is sure of his manhood.”

“Heart be stout,
And eye be true;
Good blade out!
And ill shall rue.”
