Assigned reading for a “book club” at work, else I’d never have read it otherwise. And certainly, my reading of it has been in that context. However, there is one utterly compelling central idea that will stick with me. Covey asserts that trust is a combination of “character and competence”. Much of the book hinges around this idea. It’s very similar to a pet theory I’ve nursed for several years now, although my version was a little more cynical: that a person’s success at work can be predicted by a combination of their “competence and charisma”. Their ability to do good work, and their ability to work with others (charisma in the Dungeons and Dragons sense of “force of personality”). It’s validating that Covey, who cites many others, shares a similar thought. I don’t think it outright replaces my version, but it’s similar enough that I’ll likely lean on Covey’s words in the future as more likely to lead to a shared understanding.
