Gruesome and disturbing imagery. Shadow is characterized just enough that I want to see him succeed. He experiences deep tragedy at the beginning. The opening pages paint him as stoic yet with a question mark about how exactly he came to be in prison. He loves his wife which makes her affair and death the more horrific. He recoils from Wednesday which shows that he is connected to reality. With all of this combined, I’m invested in him enough to root for him. The writing is straightforward but feels crafted.

And yet -- I won’t continue further. The bits of horror and evil that I’ve seen are more than I want to read. Especially knowing that I tend to do at least some of my reading while falling asleep, these are not images with which I want to fill my psyche before dreaming.
