First and foremost a modern philosophy text. It makes a compelling argument that all of Western thought since Aristotle has emphasized a dualistic view of reality, between subject and object. Modern science depends on observation of a subject, and the idea that the truth is found by detached observation. The book argues that there is behind all things an idea of “Quality” in the book’s words, but known in other worldviews as Good, or God. (It argues that Truth is distinct from Good?) Our modern dualistic view is so ingrained in us that we fail to participate in the world. We choose to disregard Quality or Good because it is not matter or substance. A neat takeaway is what Pirsig claims is the Japanese idea of mu, or “unasked”. It is neither one nor zero but a third thing that says “the question is poorly framed, the question cannot encompass the answer”.
