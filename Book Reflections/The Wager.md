Quite a page turner. I prefer it to [[Killers of the Blood Moon]], the book I read previously by Grann. I benefitted greatly from having read the Patrick O’Brien novels. The prior “world-building” from those books gave me a fuller appreciation from what was happening on each vessel. The reverse is also true -- I reflect differently on the O’Brien books with a more abstract appreciation for the mechanics of a squadron as well as having experienced the gravitas of real ships going down at sea and real sailors being shipwrecked and dying of hunger and infighting.
