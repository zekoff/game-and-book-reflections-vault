Odd mix of faerie tale (in the Tolkien essay sense), Arthurian legend, and outdated pop culture references. At one point Holger cries from atop his horse “Hi-yo, Silver!” because… you know, the fae are afraid of silver. Out-of-place scientific observations like when Holger comments on the thermodynamic principles that allowed him to overcome a fire-breathing dragon.

I read years ago that this book was the inspiration for the D&D Paladin class. This also references the war between Law and Chaos. This is certainly parallel with the D&D Nine Alignments, if not the direct source of inspiration.

I am half-heartedly finishing the book because I am drawn to Arthurian legend but I wouldn’t necessarily recommend it. I read it a while back and remember having more positive feelings about it. It doesn’t really stand up to re-reading.
