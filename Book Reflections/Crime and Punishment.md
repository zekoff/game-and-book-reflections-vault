Thoughts about 2/3 of the way through: I’d heard for years that this book was about a man who thought he was above the law because he’s a better class of person. It took quite some time for this idea to come out, but it did, and with force: Raskolnikov wrote an article about this very thing, how the truly exceptional man must be forgiven all bloodshed, as every action he takes must be for the betterment of man. I am looking forward to how this theme will be weighed by the end.

I’m amazed at how clearly written many of the characters are. Porfiry Petrovitch is a classic, as is Dmitri Prokhov Razhumihin, as is Sofia and Katarina Ivanhova, as is Dounia, as is even Raskolnikov himself. I was expecting for some reason that the translation would weaken the characterization, but it hasn’t. Or, if it has, then the characters must have been written with extraordinary power in Russian.

The book tangentially explores madness and mental afflictions from the perspective of one mentally afflicted. We see the mania as Raskolnikov experiences it. We know the torture of fixation and the intensity of his suffering even as we know that much of it is an affliction invisible to others.

I sense that I will return to this book years from now to see again what I get from it. Much like [[The Once and Future King]]. There is more to consider within its story than I could process on my first reading. There is a strange economy of usage in the characters. Svidrigalov turned out to be vitally important, not as a source of conflict for Dounia to develop, but as a foil for Raskolnikov. I had almost missed this connection, but thankfully the book points out specifically: why did Svidrigalov take his life when Raskolnikov did not?

Sonya is almost underused compared to how vital she is. Other characters see her as a prostitute, as an undesirable, and yet to the reader she is the most wholesome and honorable character in the book.

I still am not sure why Raskolnikov ultimately turned himself in. It was a shock and yet not a twist. A shock yet not a surprise. Perhaps he felt the same.

The use of the epilogue was effective. The story could have ended without the epilogue. And yet the epilogue shows the final arc of Raskolnikov. He continues to battle his madness or fixation with being a “genius” -- the Great Man, the one for whom laws do not apply. He alternates between “I am not a Great Man after all as my experiment proved, and thus my pride is wounded” and “I am indeed a Great Man who in a moment of weakness turned myself in, and thus must suffer as mortals do because of a brief lapse in judgement”. Then, somehow, in a way I completely believe and yet do not understand, the love of Sonya broke him and resurrected him. And thus the book ends, with the self-admission that to explore further would be a story about another man.

For a book which must have survived translation to make it to my brain, it truly fits as one of the great works.
