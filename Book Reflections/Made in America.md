I was expecting an investigation into how English has evolved over time as a result of American history and influence. To be fair, that’s basically what the back of the book summary says. Instead, the book is a collection of loosely-chronological history anecdotes and trivia, with recurring dips into “things people used to say”. So I didn’t really get what I was expecting. But what ultimately drove me away from the book was Bryson’s incessant snark. The condescending and flippant attitude often makes for turns of phrases that are humorous and even occasionally insightful, but it is better suited for a collection of essays than a history textbook. It’s like a stand-up comedian reading the encyclopedia. There are of course occasional moments of hilarity, but the tonal difference between the two styles is too much to overcome, and goes on way too long.
