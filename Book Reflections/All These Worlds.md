Bobiverse #3, and the end of the first trilogy. A fitting conclusion to the story arc built over the first and second books. This book feels like a natural trilogy capstone, even though there’s a fourth. It doesn’t leave annoying loose ends, feels suitably weighty without being in love with itself. Ultimately a neat magic trick how the author got so much mileage out of essentially one character.
