It’s amazing how well the book flows from one thing to another. If you flipped open the book to three random places and read three random paragraphs, you might think you were reading books from three different settings. Yet in the act of reading each new setting flows naturally to the next. This is highlighted almost with a wry smile when Cordelia and company are picked up after their stint as refugees in the Barryaran hills. There’s a conscious juxtaposition of their haggled and harrowing experience in the back seat as Kou and Drou are lit from the front by the cold lights of the ship’s control panel.

Minor notes in dialogue set up characters and conditions only to reappear later in perfect synchronicity with the plot. It’s not foreshadowing -- that implies more that the author is dropping information you can’t appreciate until later. Or things that take on a more significant meaning upon the second reading when the plot is know. This book would never lean on something as pedestrian and heavy-handed as foreshadowing. It’s simply that all events spring naturally from the characters we understand and that all the characterization springs naturally from events.

Bothari is a great example of this. It’s referenced maybe only once that he can’t pass as a hill dweller because of his city accent. Then, when preparing for a raid in the city, Bothari is vital because he understands city life.

Another amazing thing is the characterization of both the civilizations’s culture and of individual characters. It’s done in passing and subtly as the story is told. I contrast this against someone like Sanderson who will spend chapters, hundreds or perhaps thousands of pages, diving into the minds of characters and coming up for air with no discernably more effect than Bujold.
