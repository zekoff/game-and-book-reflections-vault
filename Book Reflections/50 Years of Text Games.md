Impressive, scholarly, professional and encyclopedic but still authored. In every area where my knowledge overlapped with the author’s, the author presented the material credibly and in context. That built trust in me as a reader. There is a great deal of editorial ownership in which games were selected, but the sheer number of works and the included list of additional notable games per year meant that the collection seemed balanced, authoritative, and comprehensive. The author certainly wrote from his own viewpoint and pulled out themes that I wouldn’t have, but it felt honest and personal rather than preachy.

I wasn’t conscious of the long and varied history text games had. I was prepared for things like [[Zork]] and even the modern Choice of Games, but this was my first exposure to the culture of the Interactive Fiction community. It feels like a tight-knit group despite its far-reaching impact.

My strongest takeaway wasn’t the impact that text games have had on broader gaming and technology spheres, although I did get some of that. I really took away what a medium unto itself that text games are. I also appreciated the inspection of technological underpinnings for many of the games -- the style of game, like the evolution from parser to hypertext (and the feeling that one is not better even though it came later, but that they are different tools even if one might be more commonly useful now), but more than style also things like what programming language or IF libraries were used in building each game. It’s also directly editorial in what games were adopted as text games, like [[Universal Paperclips]], [[Dwarf Fortress]], or [[80 Days]]. Those are certainly permissible choices but I don’t know that I would have listed them myself. The book also does a great job giving a trajectory to the 50 years, and even having an “ending” especially with the back-to-back final selections of AI Dungeon, and Scents & Semiosis. I liked the investigation of procedural versus authored content in games.

What I am taking away most strongly is how this book is prompting thoughts of what constitutes games and stories, how it’s forcing me to grapple with the people who create them and parse the author’s not-overstated but very different worldview from mine, and what I can or should be taking as I write a game a month this year and at the same time absorb the authorial intents of half a decade of other game makers. A book that I have ended up liking more than I thought I would if I’d been forced to assess it at the halfway point.
