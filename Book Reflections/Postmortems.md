There is power in simply working hard and writing about it prolifically. Raph did a great service documenting his learnings. I am more well aligned with his way of thinking than I thought I was. I need to read his [[Theory of Fun for Game Design]] again.

The logs from Koster’s MUD days are both nostalgic and cringe-inducing -- because I can see myself and my participation in that culture mirrored.

Such a fascinating tome of a luminary in this field. Koster’s design work prefigured many of the acclaimed game mechanics in years to come. 

I realize as I read this book again that Koster has influenced me strongly. I’m having an experience similar to the one I have when I reread a book by Lewis. I find how much of my thinking has either been shaped by this thinker or how much I naturally align with this thinking. Even in the latter case, though my philosophical bent may not have depended on external factors, seeing it through the lens of another and having their language helps to shape and crystallize my own thinking.

A book that had a similar effect on me was *[[Speed of Trust]]*. I had previously formulated a concept of “Competence and Charisma” being the two values needed to succeed in the workplace. My own concept was that exceptional ability in one area could cover a weakness in the other, and that people strong in both would be exceptional teammates and employees. (I had gone so far as to conceptualize ratings of the two values on a standard deviation scale, and summing the values to get a prediction of effectiveness.) But Covey’s framework gave me a slightly different yet compelling viewpoint. And more importantly, it gave me a shared language and also a reliable ethos to speak from when explaining my viewpoint to others. It’s more readily accepted by the hearer if I say “here’s something I learned from a book by an acclaimed businessman” than to say “here’s a theory I have been working on and I think it applies here.”
