I heard the term “noblebright” recently in contrast to “grimdark”. The person who introduced this term to me said that LotR is the quintessential noblebright book. I’m enjoying this readthrough. I appreciate the goodness of Tom Bombadil and the peaceful Shire. The personality of Pippin versus Merry stand out to me more now -- Pippin the impulsive and Merry the competent adventurer. I am still touched by the way Strider reveals himself as Aragorn in the room of the Prancing Pony. The use of dramatic dynamics is powerful in this book. The menace of the offscreen Black Riders is palpable but pales in comparison to what will come later. The episode with the Barrow-Wright is fearsome and indicates what history and magic and danger is present in this world.
