While reading I had a moment of realization about why it’s so popular to hate on “capitalism” in the zeitgeist right now. There are several stories of financially successful series which were canceled because they weren’t growing exponentially. Shareholders expect exponential growth which means a game which if profitable can still be a losing proposition if the investment could have been made in a growth series. This definitely helps me understand some of the rancor towards big publicly traded game companies as well as the clear tension of innovation versus risk aversion for game development.

The last chapter of the book becomes preachy. Schreier condemns big companies and their CEOs. He offers several “better” paths including mercenary development groups as well as unions. On the topic of unions in practical, he offers only the proposed benefits without exploring any of the potential costs. Since unions have been such a topic of discussion in games media for the last few years, I looked forward to learning more about the trade space in which they exist. I was disappointed that the topic was not explored in more depth. He made a few perfunctory gestures at balancing the scales on benefits and drawbacks, but it was ultimately an unsatisfying exploration. However, he started the chapter from a place of earned authority. Without a doubt, he accomplished his stated aim, which was to document the collapse of major video game studios and the factors that led to their collapses.
