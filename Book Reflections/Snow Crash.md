“Condensed fact from the vapor of nuance.” A memorable line if there ever was one. Snow Crash is 1992, [[Infinite Jest]] is 1996. Both share a sense for ultraviolence. Both share an obsession with drugs. I wonder if these are really figures of the time rather than special things connecting these two books. Stephenson shows a deep understanding of broad and unrelated cultural phenomena. Hacker culture, street culture, history of linguistics.

Takes a strange storytelling twist (vs. plot twist) about halfway through the book. There is an infodump on the author’s theory of linguistic and cognitive connection. Hiro becomes an exposition tool and the Librarian becomes a thinly-veiled PhD dissertation. The theory is fascinating if taken at face value. It’s expanded on so thoroughly that it begins to fall apart both for its storytelling use and for its dissertation purpose. I can’t think of another book that nestles such a singular assertion in the middle of its otherwise thrilling story. The dissertation portion suffers most mightily because Stephenson abandons his regularly surprising and poignant turns of phrase during this portion.

As near-future science fiction (science prediction?), it is amazing how well it foretells advancements in culture. The internet barely existed if you squinted in 1992. Yet Stephenson saw ahead to the Metaverse, a concept that is literally being given form by Meta/Facebook right now.
