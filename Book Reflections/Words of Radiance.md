Surprising that it’s still primarily on the Shattered Plains. It broadens and deepens the location but it also feels like it’s stuck in first gear.Even Shallan, whose story has been orthogonal up until this point, is now heading for the Shattered Plains. This is a world where characters will end up having superpowers and yet the main character, whose combat prowess featured in the climax of the first book, is basically “really good with spears.” 

I had forgotten Jasnah’s death. My memory is that she was not actually killed and will show up again. That said, the death is handled so quickly and with so little gravitas compared to how prominently she has featured up until now. Shallan awakes and Jasnah is dead. That’s it. Shallan recalls it maybe once or twice more as she flees but it doesn’t shake her too badly. A generous reading might be that Shallan has become numb to this after having killed her father. The reader, however, hasn’t. A missed opportunity to raise the stakes. It should have been paired also with some expansion on the role of the Ghostbloods. I’m assuming they sent the assassins.
