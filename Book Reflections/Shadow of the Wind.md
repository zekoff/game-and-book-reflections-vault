Overwrought phrasing. It sounds like the narrator is a presumptive author and is recounting a story from his childhood. That might excuse some of it.

The characters have been developed enough, including some conflict, that I have begun to be invested in them. The dialogue is improbable. Characters often engage in long monologues under the guise of conversation. Several times the author has even included parentheticals during one of these monologues. It is aggressively artificial. The effect is that often the sense of natural characterization is sacrificed to serve the author’s desire to turn a phrase.

“There's not much to tell” says a character when asked about Carax, followed by six or seven pages of lots to tell, delivered in the monologue-with-an-accomplice style that recurs in the book. 

I have considered the fact that I'm not critiquing in this case, but instead being critical. That's unfair since I don't know the context in which this book was written. I think my reaction is primarily rooted in being underwhelmed. This book was recommended to me as one of the greats. That set up expectations that may not be reasonable.

I’ve learned that the book was originally written in another language and translated to English. That does soften my position on it. And I also think it may be going for a sort of noir, detective-story feel. That would explain why characters fall in love in minutes, and why one will trust another with their life after a single meeting. It could be intentionally overwrought. The tradition of noir without the specific trappings. The mismatch, I think, is the main character. He’s a “goodest boy” and not a man of action. The goal couldn’t be more trivial -- investigating the life of a failed author whose book the main character enjoyed. And yet the stakes are absurd. A constant barrage of murder, brutality, sex, and war, yet all the primary characters have plot armor.
