A young adult novel based on the age of the protagonist but doesn’t play down to its audience. Some nice turns of phrase. Quick progression of play and action but still consistently paced and coherent. I remember this book from around middle school.

I must assume the book is deeply influenced by [[The Lord of the Rings]]. This would be one of the most astounding examples of convergent evolution in history if not. It certainly doesn’t peek out from behind that shadow but it does nest comfortably there. Gwydion is both Aragorn and Gandalf. The Cauldron-Born are something a little new. Evil like orcs but also undying. Truly a bit scary even for an adult.

Young adult novel done right. Distills and focuses the action of a great work around a youthful protagonist. Doesn’t pander.
