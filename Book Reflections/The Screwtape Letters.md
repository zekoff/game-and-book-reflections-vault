Rather quick read and, though there is no longer novelty, there is fulfillment in it. A reminder that sticks out this time is that the events of our lives are merely fodder for the Lord to work in us. It is not so much the thing that happens but how we respond. Also that some sins are more effective than others in driving us away from God. Although I recognize that idea to be untrue in the most precise theological sense, it still rings true in the experience of life. I believe it was also this book which included the notion that God is never so pleased as when a man looks around the ruin of his life and asks “why” and then goes and does God’s will nonetheless.
