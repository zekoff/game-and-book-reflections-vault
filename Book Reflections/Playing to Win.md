Sirlin bills this as his *[[The Art of War]]* is it pertains to competitive video games. When I read this years ago I couldn’t help but think that Sirlin was arrogant and unsportsmanlike. I’ve now read more of his work, played his games, and listened to interviews with him. I haven’t been completely dissuaded of my initial opinion. However, I have softened a bit. He is clear upfront that his book is about how to win. It’s not for people who want to bask in the purity of a game design or who want to play socially. It’s for people who want to go to a tournament and win at the highest levels in any game. I understand better as a result of this book that “playing to win” means playing an entirely different game than “playing for fun.”

Sirlin highlights two primary traits of a true competitor: appraisal and adaptability. Appraisal is the ability to judge the worth of an action or resource. The ability to understand its properties and understand the situation to know when those properties are most valuable. Adaptability is the respond to a situation with the optimal move. It occurs to me that these two properties go hand in hand. Understanding of the situation and possible responses requires appraisal, and ability to execute a winning move requires adaptability.

What do my predilections in competitive games say about me? This would include games like [[Super Smash Bros. series]] and [[World of Warcraft]], where I took success seriously and remained committed past the point of leisure. I like testing and understanding the breadth of the game. Playing all characters, exploring all areas, understanding all items and abilities. I am good at the people aspect of the games -- leading raids in WoW, reading my opponent in Smash. I like preparation. Spending time in training modes or using resources outside of the game like strategy guides or build crafting tools.

And, what do my predilections in leisure games say about me? I like “to see numbers go up”. The feeling of grinding to higher power levels. I still love playing all classes, understanding all skills and items and abilities. In contrast to competitive games, I do not like to utilize resources outside of the game like strategy guides or buildcrafting tools. I prefer to learn the intricacies on my own. Bartle would say that I suit Explorer.
