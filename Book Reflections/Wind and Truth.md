Although years had passed in the real world between [[Rhythm of War]] and WaT, only a single day passed in the universe. Despite that there seem to be major shifts in characters. The book nods at things like “so-and-so had been changing and I’m just now noticing this.” Nonetheless, characters seem more different in one day between the fourth and fifth books than they did in the one year between the third and fourth books.

Stormlight lore centers around things being unbalanced. 10 radiant orders 9 fused orders. Three gods on roshar two of which have storms. 10 surges and each radiant order has two but there don't appear to be consistent patterns like one axis is these traits and opposite to that axis are the complementary traits. 

This book in particular is going way out of its way to normalize hot social topics in the real world right now and then providing explicit commentary on them. It's firmly ensconcing itself as a product of its time. Typically that approach doesn't age well. 

It also is deeply enamored of itself. It spends so much time inside the heads of its many characters. Every time it starts to go on a run of peeling back lore mysteries, it makes sure to stay one step ahead teasing new mysteries. [[The Lord of the Rings]] points at its lore but doesn't lean on it for mystery. Lost points at its lore and uses it to shroud what it is doing in any given moment.

Over halfway through now. The book is often preachy. The most recent example is how Kaladin attempts to minister to Szeth. He is preparing to say something about how Szeth is loved by his parents. Sanderson leads up to this moment of humanity with several qualifier statements about how this statement wouldn’t be appropriate for everyone, and how Kaladin is going out on a limb by saying it, and then delivers the statement. It robs it of any punch and it’s inappropriate for the setting which is explicitly specified to have no existing discipline of “therapy.” Again, the book spends so much time walking through characters’ every thought plus editorializing on those thoughts. It is dead-set on telling the reader what to think. It’s patronizing.

There are just too many threads to follow and by necessity there’s constant context-switching between them. Right there there: a hero’s journey in Shin, two loosely-connected excursions into the Spiritual Realm, and three distinct battlefronts (Azir, Thaylen City, Narak). Each of these six story thrusts has multiple main characters and subplots: Azir has not only the main battle but also the underlying troop and character movements in Shadesmar. Szeth’s journey also has flashbacks to his childhood. Those are only examples. Then, on top of that, most of the main characters are having some kind of further development of their character, usually accompanied by plumbing the depths, the dregs, of their psyches. On top of all that there is development of new characters or the expansion of previously minor characters.

It’s just. Too. Much. Every time the context switches I realize I’ve forgotten significant things that were introduced during the previous visit to a context. I need a refresher every chapter in order to keep up. That’s not a suggestion. That’s an indication that things are out of control. It’s a maximalist approach to storytelling that exceeds my capacity for recall and has become narrative mush. It also context switches often right at the moment of excitement. Adolin trapped in the throne room with Abidi and without his blade -- Abidi moves to strike, and! … Wonder what Shallan was up to last time we saw her?

There have been instances of quips that appear to exist for their own sake, not well-integrated into the setting. The two off the top of my head come from Sylphrena. Kaladan notices that two different varieties of spren have names based on numbers. He comments on that fact. Syl says “that was actually kind of racist.” The term “race” has never appeared in the thousands of pages before than, nor has racism been a thematic exploration. In another instance Syl says “that guy was a tool, and this is coming from a girl who is currently a spear.” It absolutely matches Syl as a character. It absolutely does not match the setting. “Tool” as a pejorative is very much of a moment in the real world. It has no precedent in the world of Roshar.

He takes great pains to dance carefully around any wording that could be construed as demeaning toward any state of mind or judgement about mental health. He also frequently says things that are sort of therapist gobbledygook. “His past didn’t excuse his actions, but it did explain them.” “Szeth wasn’t healed, but he was getting better.” “Shallan couldn’t escape the visions, but she could weather them.” “Renarin still was a little different, but now \[suddenly, inexplicably, with no onscreen character growth in the past 10,000 pages\] he had become a leader.”

If there are consistent thematic things, it’s 1) how far would you go for the people you love, and 2) can anyone ever really see the bigger picture and does it matter? A bit of exploration of the greatest good for the greatest number. But it’s very explicit and in-your-face. Two characters literally have a debate about it. And you get to live through one of them dancing around the topic inside her own head.

Relies not on a twist, nor truly on foreshadowing, but on creating mystery and raising questions. That’s playing the short game. The correct answer is leave things mysterious. The best you can hope to do other than that is simply answer the questions later. Whatever answer you give, it won’t be as good as the mystery. At worst, you get Lost.

Ishar says “be quiet child, the adults are trying to save the world.” A modern quip for the sake of itself. This happens often. And in this case it doesn't even match this character, who thinks he is god. In every way it doesn't match. Not tonally consistent, not appropriate for the world, too humble for a megalomanic. 

Kaladin talks about trauma, a word and concept which has no precedent in the world. How much more interesting if Kaladin did what he is doing with less editorializing? Sanderson doesn't trust the reader. Everything has to be spelled out.

I regret spending the first six months of this year reading this arc.
