The series strayed far from what I initially loved about it by the time I got to this book. However, I came to value Le Guin’s afterwords more and more with each book. It was fascinating to hear her speak so directly to what she wanted to communicate with each book, and where she was intentionally subversive. Knowing what she intended to do with the book, I believe that she accomplished it. Whether it was what I was looking for is my own business -- she did not pander to her reader, and I appreciated this. Of all of the books in this series, this one seemed the most personal, specific, and reflective of the author herself.
