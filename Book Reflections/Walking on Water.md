“Reflections on Faith and Art”. As much a loosely-ordered collection of musings as it is a cover-to-cover book. (As I read the subtitle, I supposed it is indeed a set of reflections on faith and art.) It most strongly brings to mind C.S. Lewis and [[Mere Christianity]]. It is directly, openly Christian in its worldview, and yet it is not dogmatic or theological. Occasionally I discern some of L’Engle’s personal theology poking through, and I’m not always sure I agree with it, and yet I continue to read with an openness similar to the way I approach Lewis, which is indeed the way he asks us to approach his Mere Christianity. I consider that perhaps L’Engle has views with which I do not agree, and that it may be me who is incorrect. Or, better, that somehow we are both correct. Also like Mere Christianity, I sense that this is a book I will find myself unconsciously shaped by in years to come, and only later upon re-reading will I find something I believed to be my own thought is in fact something I read here.

I came to this book as ostensibly a treatise on what it means to be a Christian artist. It has turned out to be that, but not exactly in the way I supposed it would be. I was expecting apologetics, and this is (I say cheekily) unapologetic. It is a set of statements about how a Christian approaches art. To some degree prescriptive (how a Christian should approach art), but more I find descriptive, of L’Engle reporting on how she approaches her art.

A few takeaways so far:

- The idea quoted from someone else that there is a great lake of “art” and all artists contribute to it. Some are mighty rivers, some are trickles and tributaries, but all feed the body of art if they contribute in honesty.
- The idea that all true art is Christian in that it reveals something about Creation, and therefore must be Christian.
- That an artist serves the work and must follow where it leads.
- That by limiting ourselves to conscious thought, those thoughts which we can order and direct, we fail to use much of our minds and perhaps large parts of our intellectual gifts. I think back to when I would drive to Dadeville in the early morning half-asleep, and what creativity sprang from a mind that was not ordered (not in disarray, chaos, but without being rigidly ordered to a task, cosmos).

I can see a dim path ahead in my own game design when I view through the lens of this book. I have reflected even this year about how I find that I am “discovering” the games I make as I make them. I shape them even as I am shaped by what I find.

I have thought often in the weeks since reading this book of the heuristic that her husband used when declining a “juicy” role as an actor. He asked himself “would I want the children to see this?” L’Engle observed that perhaps this question cuts to the quick of morality.
