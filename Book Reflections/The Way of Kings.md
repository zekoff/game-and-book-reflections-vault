I’ve read this before but plan to go through Books 1-4 in preparation for Book 5 which was released at the end of 2024. When I first read the series, I overall thought it might be the only thing that was in the same tier as [[The Lord of the Rings]]. I’ll be curious to find out if I still feel the same.

I have found myself surprisingly bewildered as I start again. I’ve forgotten a lot of the worldbuilding and the importance of characters. It’s coming back but it certainly wasn’t crystalized in my mind.

The writing feels modern. Very approachable despite characters, especially Dalinar, having a little bit of fantasy-speak. Sanderson is probably brilliant and it comes through in some characters but doesn’t always land for me. I think of the way Jasnah describes the difference between religion and scientific study, or the way that Wit talks about… everything. Quippy and full of observations that are intended to be poignant but aren’t always. The book feels less timeless than LotR although I didn’t know what it was like to read LotR when it was first released.

The action is often described the way an action movie appears. It absolutely works but it helps to frame it mentally as if watching a movie.

It’s so clear, and so powerful in hindsight, that the story was planned thoroughly ahead of time. Book 1 doesn’t stand on its own necessarily but it’s clear Sanderson wasn’t counting on that either. From a look at the associated Wikipedia page, it looks like Sanderson was well into his published career before releasing the first Stormlight book. It absolutely comes through that this is not a novice. It’s an experienced writer working in his prime. I think of how Amplitude Studios released the Endless 4X games before tackling human history. Even though their final goal was to dethrone Civ, they practiced their craft in other ways first before attempting a magnum opus.
