Dove into the first translation I came across without stopping to evaluate others. This ended up OK but I did sample a couple of other ones after I got a little ways in. The translations do make a difference. I honestly am not sure who translated the one I read. The cover art says “Mackail” but the reviews mention Fagle who I saw was commonly used. I tried what I think might be Fitzgerald but it also has several other translators tagged. Regardless, the one I read is written as prose versus the other transliterated as rhyming poetry.

The gods drive nearly everything in this tradition. The Trojan Horse was taken in not because the Trojans were stupid, but because they wanted to appease whatever god they thought was relevant. Dido fell in love with Aeneas not for his own charms but because gods willed it. It's not that the characters are passive but it's different how little agency they have. The drama is partially in how they are dated to walk a path they didn't choose. American literature, especially modern literature, is all about the agency of man. Characters impose their will on events and the drama comes from the collision between those wills.

About three-quarters done and I’m pretty much over this book. I suspect it is the translation which I’m having trouble with. The two biggest issues I have are 1) the multiple names for things continue to confuse me, especially since I don’t know the historical context well, and 2) major shifts like transitions to new places or dramatic shifts in relationships happen in a paragraph or two and results in a “blink and you miss it” feeling if your brain wanders on one of those critical pages.

In retrospect: I did approach the book from most likely a different perspective than a contemporary reader. The gods not only manipulate but essentially directly control each character. Even to the very end. In the duel between Aeneas and Turnus, Turnus is undone because of an omen which tells him he will die. Maybe the context of this work is the in-baked assumption that fate defines everything and the characters are just players on a stage acting out a script. That’s simply not the modern Western assumption, where Great Men control their own destiny, and conflict occurs when the Great Men have competing desires. It actually lowers the stakes a little in that way. The conclusion is foreordained.

It does serve a purpose if this work is the origin story of the Roman Empire though. It says that Rome is destined for its greatness by the implacable will of the gods.

There is some wiggle room for how the characters move within the confines of fate. Aeneas could have shown mercy to Turnus but didn’t.
