Creative and unlike much else I can think of. The plot threads weave back and forth across two timelines but that isn’t clear until well into the book. The threads eventually unite in a way that is enabled by the very device of the Road. The details of the dragon race are left unanswered but they are still satisfying because it’s clear how everything fits together by the end.
