Knights are cast as figures of Honor. Greatcoats are cast as figures of Justice.The books are just beginning to dip toes into these vast waters. It could be the source of exploration and of the book Saying Something. I don’t think I should be disappointed if this doesn’t pan out. The book is well-written and enjoyable. It’s fine to simply stand on the merits of its plot. Perhaps this is simply theme -- a set of footholds that tie the book to something bigger.
