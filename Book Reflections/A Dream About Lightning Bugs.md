“A jackass of all trades.” Fantastic line that summarizes Ben's recollection of himself.

The chapter on finding your voice is the focal point of the book for me so far. It’s got Ben’s thoughts on finding his own voice, and seems to be positioned at the fulcrum between his formative years and his entry onto the main stage as Ben Folds the mainstream performer. It’s the arming of the hero. And I’ve found it applicable even to myself. He talks about finding yourself as peeling off the parts that aren’t you. Applicable both in my own music and in life more generally, even professionally.

Overall the book is autobiographical with a side of life lessons that Ben hopes to impart. Not all of the lessons land for me, but I respect what he’s doing. And the book is kind of entertaining on its own because of the sheer number of wild experiences that Ben has had.

“Let us then jam, motherf@#$ers.”
