Second in the Wheel of Time series. I had initially decided not to read through this series but had a couple of folks reference it positively enough that I decided to give it a second try. I love how Rand is a goody-two-shoes. It’s refreshing. It also continues to be the most generic possible 90s fantasy story, like a whole book made from a collection of D&D Forgotten Realms starter adventures -- but perhaps that’s because it loomed so large in the 90s that it molded the culture, instead of the other way around. Paid off at the end with plot events, the feeling of things at stake and changing the status quo, and some hooks to a broader and interesting world (the heroes across the ages who answer the horn). It definitely feels like a book that is going to run to 14 in the series, but with at least more sense of interest and movement than the first one.
