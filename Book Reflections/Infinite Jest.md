Encountered this book by hearing it discussed in a game design podcast. It was used as an example of a piece of art so far beyond critical assessment that it’s like “an alien spaceship… you might be able to take it apart and see some of the pieces but it’s impossible to figure out how it all works.”

I read the forward and was a little skeptical, as my tastes in books are apparently relatively classic and even pedestrian, and the author of the forward heralds this book as a modern miracle, a post-post-modern work, a deconstruction of American media culture, etc. And… boy, is it apparently long. When I opened it, Kindle estimated it at a 42 hour read for me, or something like that.

However, I’m not completely put off yet. It’s got style and it’s still readable. I can’t say I’ll stick with it but I’m here so far.

About a quarter of the way into the book, I’m starting to understand it. There are enough threads of a plot hanging out there that I can begin weaving them together. There is enough characterization, explanation, and overlap in the vignettes that I can see a structure. Idiosyncrasies like years named after products are being explained. There is even some foreshadowing perhaps, with Hal’s inexplicable behavior in his interview hanging out there, while in the main thrust of the timeline he and Pemulis are gearing up for a weekend of experimentation with a weapons-grade drug. And the unseen video that was James Incandenza’s last production just might be this far-fetched mind-wiping cassette.

The book is written in such a strange way that defies easy following of it’s plot. That holds true at a structural level as well as a sentence level, with unusual ways of phrasing and framing things, and odd subject material like a prep tennis academy. Yet those things surely exist and the students who attend must have rich inner lives like anyone else.

It should perhaps be noted that I solidified in this positive opinion while I was reading in the middle of the night after having awakened. That is a situation where… let's say, I am most effective at free association in my thinking.

The book explores addiction in great depth and nuance. It also has moments of intense, disturbing, and memorable violence.

Over the course of the book, many different threads begin weaving together. Characters dip in and out of prominence. Joelle van Dyne is expanded upon, gradually gives way to Don Gately. Hal remains consistent but in the part I just read suddenly shifts to the first person when the whole book has been third person. Steeply is examined and then becomes a supporting character when he visits the Enfield Tennis Academy. Kate Gompert gets a chapter at the beginning and then shows up, just barely out of memory, at Enfield House. Poor Tony Krause is given whole chapters to himself before becoming suddenly “de-mapped” off camera by the Canadian terrorist group. Orin is revealed as having been a victim of incest, and so many other characters share similar and horrifying abuse in their past. Generational sin. The book not only pulls no punches, it makes me question whether it slants to the grotesque for effect, or whether it actually captures a realistic cross-section of America.

One of this book’s most core subjects is generational sin. I don’t know that the author would have used that term but it recurs throughout. Jim is raised by an alcoholic and aggressive father, and becomes an alcoholic and passive father himself. Orin is abused by this mother and then passes on sin to women he seduces. Countless minor characters in 12-step meetings share tales of family depravity. It’s a clear and often explicitly acknowledged line from their trauma to their abuse of substances.

Characters continued to be surprise-revealed in more depth at points in the book. Avril was a shadow until halfway through the book. Joelle Van Dyne was literally shadowed in her radio booth and in her veil until more of her story is revealed bit by bit. Jim Incandenza is known only by his negative space until near the very end of the book, when suddenly he is reflected upon in much greater detail (in shocking first-person) by his son Hal, and revealed to be… not that bad a guy.

There is a moment where the book suddenly shifts to first person in Hal’s voice and it’s immediately disconcerting. I got a paragraph in of feeling disoriented before I realized what had happened. Thousands of pages of third person and then this, out of nowhere.

John Wayne the tennis star described as a “grim machine”, a tremendous phrase.

Annular. The book begins further than where it ends. I finished reading and immediately started again. I wanted to connect the dots on what happened to Hal. I now think he took the psychedelic drugs from Pemulis’s hiding spot. In Hal’s final scene, he's already taken them. Orin is about to go through a technical interview. What happens to him? Something happened to JvD but I'm not quite sure what. There was no closure to the end. All plot threads left dangling. I feel… tricked. But as if someone fooled me with a good riddle. I was tricked but glad to be.
