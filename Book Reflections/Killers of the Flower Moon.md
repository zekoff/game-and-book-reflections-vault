Historical crime journalism. Reminds me a little of the amateur investigative reporting of Up and Vanished. The depictions of violence are gruesome to the point of sensationalism, but that's fair given how horrific the crimes were. The book falters in the third and final part, but that actually mirrors the faltered investigation nicely. These crimes didn't get a nice clean investigation with a clear conviction.
