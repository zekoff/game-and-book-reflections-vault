Fires the imagination, unlike much of the fantasy I’ve read in the last year. I obviously hold Sanderson in high regard, but there is something different about this style than a Sanderson, or certainly than a Jordan. The phrase “truth, not fact” comes to mind. When describing a dragon, Le Guin doesn’t say “thirty feet high,” she says “of a height with the broken tower.” Wizards, sorcerers, and mages don’t seem to be interchangeable, but there is little enough detail that it’s mysterious. The magic simply is, without extensive explanation. What little explanation is about balance -- the cost of magic. Rain in one place could be drought in another.

There’s a wonderful bit with Ged where Vetch says something like “there is greatness ahead of you.” Ged, still healing from his experience with the shadow he summoned, stands and says “but what is behind me?” as Le Guin observes the shadow Ged casts on the wall behind when he stands.

Much in this book has the feeling of truth though it isn’t fact. Ged, to Yarrow who after hearing that all power comes from a single source (life, light, time), asks “What of Death?”: “A word must be spoken into silence, both before and after.” Other things threaded through the book: “This tower is surrounded by many walls, and not all of them are made of stone.” “You are very clear-sighted, but you do not see all things. There are other magics besides those taught in Roke.” “At this time, I hold that…” (as in, when I learn more, I may believe something different). “I am a servant, but I am not your servant… I will return when I can.”

Upon reading the afterword, I was surprised to learn that this was written as a young adult novel, and also that it intentionally included “subversive” elements in the skin tone of Ged and Vetch. I hadn’t thought twice about it when I read it, but now almost roll my eyes that there was attempted subversion. I suppose I am grateful that I was raised so that it did not strike me as subversive. And I am… embarrassed? that this was written for young adults and I liked it so much. Although I am equally intrigued -- what makes this a young adult novel? Is it that it is relatively straightforward, without big words? It is thematically and truthfully rich, wholesome, without burden of pretense. If that’s what makes a young adult novel, then give me more.

I like this book so much that I actually considered not reading more. For fear of what happened with [[Dune]] -- that I might come to like the book less if I continue in the world. Let there be mystery and questions without answers. The more authorial imprint put upon me, the less my mind is free to live in a world half of my own making. Ignorance is bliss. Yet I did go ahead and start reading the next book in the series.
