Right out of the gate, Logan channels Captain Malcom Reynolds. He is a heroic antihero. Extremely practical, witty and resigned commentary, full of grit, a disillusioned war veteran, and a survivor.

Near the end Logen goes full-on berserker. It completely explains how the Bloody Nine came by his name. It also neatly ties with the mythical concept of the northern berserker.
