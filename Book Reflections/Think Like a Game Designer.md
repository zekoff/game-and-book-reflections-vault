Potent combination of practical how-to as well as philosophical best practices for game design. Leans heavily towards the practical side versus the theoretical. Outlines a useful game design framework for iteration, and then the phases of focus within which you iterate through the game design loop. Excellent descriptive work but stops short of being prescriptive. It also contains many distilled nuggets of wisdom that I’ve picked up similarly over many years of consulting other sources, and so can corroborate that they are inline with other proficient designers. The author’s pedigree as a successful designer also gives him a lot of gravitas. The other thing I was impressed by is the comparative brevity. He offers a tremendous amount of actionable wisdom in a fairly short read. It doesn’t feel light on any subject, just feels like he was respectful of the reader’s time. And the book contains exercises but enough meat on the bone that it never comes across as a workbook -- more like a “call to action” to spur the person on the fence into actually maturing a design. It also explores topics like publishing and the economy of games, so it’s practical for someone who actually wants to get a game into the world. Written from a humble viewpoint where the author gives plenty of examples of his own successful designs, but also false starts and lessons learned. Honest without being self-deprecating. The most astonishing thing though was that the author ends the book with his personal cell phone number and the offer for a consultation. Never seen anything like that, and it’s something I want to adopt.
