The last time I read this book was probably a decade ago. I remember being… almost underwhelmed by it at the time. And yet, reading it again now, the most striking thing for me was how clearly I am aligned with its perspective, and indeed how clearly I even recall certain specific examples that Koster uses. The fundamental thesis is that “fun” is a buzz our brains get from learning patterns. He does expand on certain details, like what elements of a game are likely to produce recognizable patterns. A lot of the book is also a call to action or rallying cry or philosophical perspective on the duty of game designers to shepherd the medium. He talks about game designers specifically working with “ludemes”, but a complete game requiring many more fields of study (graphics, story, sound) and the overall game director is actually the one responsible for the impact of the work.

My biggest takeaway is how strongly this book must have shaped my thinking without me knowing it. Much like C. S. Lewis did for me years before in a different field. Or, perhaps how accurately this book captures my natural inclinations and gives me a language to think about it.
