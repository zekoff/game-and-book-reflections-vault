Feels very modern. I had in my mind that this book was written in the 50s or 60s, but I think it’s more likely it was written in the 80s perhaps. It has the sort of pop-physics trappings that were so impressive to me as a preteen or early teen. There is a young-adult-novel feel to it, probably in the way that Meg is troubled by the dramas of high school, and the suspiciously quick way that she and Calvin fall for one another, and the pairing of “ugly duckling Meg” and “cool but secretly nerdy Calvin.” However, it’s not handled distastefully.

I checked the book out later on Wikipedia, and it was first published in 1962, after all. I am astonished. It must have felt like a book from the future for its first readers.
