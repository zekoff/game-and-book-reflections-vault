Leads up to the “Bloodbath of B-R5RB”. A battle that cost about $400,000 in real money based on conversion rates in 2014. Less coherent a story than [[Empires of Eve - Volume 1]] because of the ponderous number of alliances and the unclear way that they aligned with one another during this era of the game.

Fascinating to learn about the complexity in fleet composition.

Drove home again the idea that players play for fun. There is one metagame strategy where leaders will intentionally set up systems which suck fun out of combat for opponents. This makes them stop logging in for a time since the game is temporarily not fun. Ultimately that produces the same results as destroying their ships. It robs them of the ability to project force in the game. A metagame strategy to be sure and yet fits with Sirlin’s thesis of playing to win. The most effective coalition leaders understand this type of dynamic intimately. In addition they understand the value of propaganda campaigns and spying.

Perhaps this game is a great study in real life espionage. It makes me think the seedy underbelly of nation-state spying is much worse that I think it is. Shares the trait with OpenDominion that the true game is all about information and that it takes place in Discord rather than in the game client.
