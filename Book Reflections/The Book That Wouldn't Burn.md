Only read a few chapters in -- another rare book where I stopped before finishing. The protagonist is oddly omnicompetent for a small child. It comes across as a character designed backwards from an end state rather than one that grows in step with the story. There is also ample profanity, violence, and literal grit. I saw a few teases towards mysteries I’d liked to have read more about. But not at the cost of slogging through the other stuff.
