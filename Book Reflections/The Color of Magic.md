Very enjoyable. I read somewhere that this book was “meant to do for fantasy what Blazing Saddles did for western \[cowboy\] genre tropes”. It feels like it did so. It was funny but often a subtle humor. Even arch, at times? I came in expecting jokes, and I got something less openly funny but also that would probably stand up to re-reading in a way that perhaps [[Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy]] does not.
