Multiverse-style crossover match of many horror figures. Jack the Ripper, a witch, Rasputin, a druid, Elder Gods, a werewolf, vampire, and others.

It seems one of the trademarks of Zelazny books is a detour into dream worlds. Not necessarily of the same substance in each book but of the same essence -- extensive description of impossible sights blended of careful inclusion of some details and intentional absence of others. 

In the dream world excursion here I see shadows of [[The House on the Borderland]]. The Elder Gods are mentioned by name and there is a narrated traversal of the landscape. Here though the landscape is inhabited by more than horrors and so has a different feel.
