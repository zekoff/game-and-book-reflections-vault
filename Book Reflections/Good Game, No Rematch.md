Glib. A little mean. Unmetered. Lack of clarity on what the book is. A memoir of someone in the games industry? A time ordered recollection of particular games for this person? Jokes are incessant. The vast majority do not land. I've gotten a couple of genuine laughs but at the cost of dozens and dozens of throwaway quips. Nearly every paragraph has one or more of these. This book may be targeted at younger readers who find the edginess amusing and who likely have no history in many of the games covered. That demographic could find something here. 

As the book has progressed into Drucker’s adult life it has become more relatable. The jokes are still too frequent and a little too “low” for me. It would have benefitted from an editing pass where Drucker removed the bottom half the jokes. The top half wouldn’t always land but they’d land more often and harder by comparison.
