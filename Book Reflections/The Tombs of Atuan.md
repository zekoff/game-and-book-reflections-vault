“She did feel it. A dark hand had let go its lifelong hold upon her heart. But she did not feel joy, as she had in the mountains. She put her head down in her arms and cried, and her cheeks were salt and wet. She cried for the waste of her years in bondage to a useless evil. She wept in pain, because she was free.

“What she had begun to learn was the weight of liberty. Freedom is a heavy load, a great and strange burden for the spirit to undertake. It is not easy. It is not a gift given, but a choice made, and the choice may be a hard one. The road goes upward toward the light; but the laden traveler may never reach the end of it.”

Truth. This has the firmness and depth of truth. Of the first book I’d say it has the highest ratio of truth-to-words outside of scripture. And this too is a moment of truth.

The evil in this book is primal evil. Evil that was latent in the world from when it was formed. Nameless, ancient gods, aspects of hatred. The shadow in the first book is not nameless but is an aspect of hatred nonetheless. This book associates the nameless ancient evil with death. Compare to cosmic horror, where the evil is evil of madness for humans and indifference for the beings, outside of reality. Or compare to the banal, petty evil of a comic book villain, evil of mastery over other men for its own sake, for the love of power, itself an attempt to salve inner brokenness.
