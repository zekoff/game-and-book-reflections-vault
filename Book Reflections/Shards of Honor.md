Writing is atmospheric and unselfconscious. It goes from grounded sci-fi to capital ship laser battles to psychological thriller with politics as the consistent connective tissue. It’s impressive upon reflection how much ground the book covers while still flowing naturally and coherently. There was a shocking moment where I almost teared up as Vorkosigan pins his lieutenant’s tabs on his loyal ensign. That is the sort of scene that will always pique my father-son nerve but it can’t happen without me buying in completely to Vorkosigan’s character.

I read Bujold’s auto-bibliography (is that a thing?) where she recommends a reading order for the Vorkosigan saga. Even though I’m looking forward to the Miles books as the main event, I’m going next to the chronological continuation of the Aral/Cordelia arc.
