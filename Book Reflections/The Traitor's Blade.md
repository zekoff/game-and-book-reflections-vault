It took me a moment to switch gears into this book. Like the First Law trilogy, it’s a low-fantasy-ish world shaped by political forces with strong central characters and first-person narration. So, when the core trio began a minutes-long quipfest while surrounded by hostile and well-armed enemies, my first reaction was to roll my eyes. Then it clicked. This is a comic book movie. It’s The Avengers: Three Musketeers. The book is the delight in seeing these competent characters and how they handle the scraps they find themselves in. It’s the fun of letting a good script wash over your ears. If [[The Princess Bride]] were told entirely in first person from Wesley’s perspective, it would end up something like this book.

The First Law trilogy used competence sparingly. It was tied to moments of importance or character development. Each battle felt like a threat -- I’d hold my breath waiting to find out if this was where Logen would die. This approach was effective. It gave a sense of stakes to the events in the book, and it made the highs seem higher by comparison. But The Traitor’s Blade reminds me that there are other approaches.
