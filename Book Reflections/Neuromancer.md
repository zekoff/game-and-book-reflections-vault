In contrast to [[American Gods]] (and so many other books) I have no reason to root for Case yet. I’m 10% or so in and don’t understand why I should care whether this thief, betrayer, addict, and aspirational murderer lives or dies. Several chapters back would have been the point in some novels where this character dies or at least goes off screen to be replaced with a true protagonist. However, I'm curious enough about the world to keep going for now. (And perhaps out of a vague guilt since I just abandoned another book.) It is likely that this book heavily influenced the cyberpunk genre. I already see deep connections in setting between this and [[Cyberpunk 2077]], which itself was influenced by the Cyberpunk TTRPG, which itself was influenced by Neuromancer.

Published in 1983. I don't know where this fits in the history of the cyberpunk genre although I'm assuming it's one of the first. It does give a sense of what I associate with Cyberpunk 2077, enough that I've gone back to that game as a result. 

Generally though the book is incoherent. Void of both sympathetic protagonists and clear plot. I vaguely understand that it's a heist book where the team is being manipulated by AI who blackmails Case. Unclear why Molly sticks it out other than just “it's who I am.” Armitage/Corto is impenetrable until he flips to insane and then dies. I don't at all understand the characters of Peter or 3Jane. It's not clear what Wintermute or Rio, the AI pieces, are trying to accomplish. Essentially I don't understand the motivations of any character in this book. The action is also incident. Often there will be a series of events relayed that skips part of the coherent sequence.
