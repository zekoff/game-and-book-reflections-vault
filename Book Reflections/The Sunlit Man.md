Solid Sanderson book and Cosmere book. It’s fun to learn a little ways in where Nomad (AKA Sigzil, and his other earned name in the book escapes me suddenly) is really from, and what his relationship with Auxiliary really is. A lot of the book is fun in the way that [[Super Smash Bros. series]] is fun: it’s neat because it brings together a bunch of elements into a multiverse and you get to see them collide. Sigzil turns out to behave as the hero we hope for, even though he’s not even sure himself that he really is. But that’s part of what makes the book unique. Like much of Sanderson’s work, there’s fun worldbuilding as details are shared about how and why the magic in the book works.
