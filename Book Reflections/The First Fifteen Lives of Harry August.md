Recommended by a friend, but disappointing. The book hinges on a small collection of people who are reborn each time they die. The main problem is that the central character, Harry August, is an unremarkable character, and written in an unremarkable style. There is little exploration of who Harry is as a person, despite having fifteen lives (maybe a few less, as some of them are glossed over) to provide characterization. He doesn’t have any memorable traits as a character besides his superpower. There is not much exploration of the secret society of others like Harry. And what becomes the central plot of the book, with Harry chasing after a man who wants to advance technology faster than history allows it, feels incredibly low-stakes. A case where the reader is told what a horrendous thing that would be, without showing why it’s so horrendous. Even the given reason for it being bad is rather hand-wavy: it will prevent future people like Harry from being born somehow? The book does surprisingly little with the premise.
