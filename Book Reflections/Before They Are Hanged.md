Malacus Quai is characterized differently. It seems like he’s being set up to betray Bayaz and the rest of the group.

The viewpoint is now switching regularly between a siege in Dagoska, a war in Angland, and the travels of Logen and company to the Edge of the World. I assume that they are seeking the Seed of Life, whatever that will be. It’s foreshadowed as something of terrible power. One Magus tells Bayaz it’s evil. Bayaz responds that evil is a concept for children. This is an interesting characterization and it distances the book a little from Tolkienesque good and evil.

Logen just becomes more and more compelling. The way he patiently begins to bind his group together with small acts of kindness. His prowess in combat is basically assumed in a book like this, but its absence would be notable, so it’s important that it’s emphasized. Even Jeral is becoming humanized. His wound in his first combat is a turning point for him and all the stronger because he’s been characterized as such a worthless dandy.
