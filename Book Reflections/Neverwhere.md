I’ve had Gaiman hyped in my mind since hearing game designer Justin Gary rave about him and quote him: “If people tell you something is wrong \[with your design\], they’re almost always right. If they tell you how to fix it, they’re almost always wrong.” Great quote.

The imagery in this book has been grotesque at times but not over the invisible line the way [[American Gods]] was. Richard Mayhew is a loveable goof. This is established early on through his relationship with Jessica as a foil.

I’m near the end now and still don’t have a real sense of high stakes. I’m not sure if that was intended. The angel Islington generically wants to rule the world and was responsible for the destruction of Atlantis. Those are reasonable villain bonafides. So much of his time is spent offscreen though. Croup and Vandemar are far more present and fearsome. They are essentially only patsies though.

There are a few funny moments in a dry, Bill Bryson way. Otherwise this is about as straightforwardly competent as I can imagine a story. It’s the Yuengling of adventure stories: straight down the middle, of forgettable quality.
