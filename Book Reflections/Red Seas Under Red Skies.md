Did not reach the heights of the first book, but very enjoyable. Felt like a detour in many ways, and really the nautical digression took the feel of the book in a very different direction. Feels like a side-story even though it’s a sequel. Made a strong case for the friendship/brotherhood of Locke and Jean. Perhaps it’s because of the nautical theme, but it recalls the relationship between Aubrey and Maturin.
