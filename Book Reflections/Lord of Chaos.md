“Book Six of ‘The Wheel of Time’. I… I just don’t know if I can do another one of these books. How am I only in book six?!

I gave up on this book. I may actually even just read a series summary. I don’t think I can make it to the Sanderson parts.

I am tired of reading from Nynaeve’s viewpoint. She is an unpleasant lens through which to view the world. Neither has her character developed much over many thousands of pages. Rand, the everyman goody-two-shoes who was at least a consistent viewpoint for the first novel, has also become similarly unknowable. Mat has deepened but is only one viewpoint of many at this point. Same for Perrin. Lan and Moiraine, the most mysterious pair, have respectively disappeared as a viewpoint, and been killed off.

Basically, this series sure does a lot of telling instead of showing.
