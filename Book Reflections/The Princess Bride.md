Great book, and certainly everything great about the movie has its roots here. More than roots, the script is at times adapted word-for-word from the book. The only major element the movie is missing is the Zoo of Death and the backstories of Inigo/Fezzik, and I prefer the book characterizations of Rugen and even Humperdinck. The book is a little heavy on the framing story, to the point that it wore on me this second time reading it. But the movie is shockingly close in how it captures the book.
