Contains a somewhat explicit and shocking sex scene. It’s not described in great detail but it’s an extension of the shock value that started in the second book and quite out of step with the first book. To the author’s credit, it’s not gratuitous, in the sense that the level of detail is actually used to build on and specify the relationship between two major characters. It is referenced later (in no detail) and does fit with their arc.

Logen is used less as a fearsome but likable character and more as a tragic hero. The thing that sets him apart is the very thing that is unsettling and which is the root cause of the many that hate him. This is achieved through his inner voice and narration. He is consumed by self-condemnation as he returns to the North. The earlier books leaned on his relationships while this one leans on his deeds and the fallout of those deeds. He spends a lot of time questioning his past and bringing only violence. It’s not a change in his characterization. It’s a focus on something different and it distances him from the reader.

Throughout the books each narrator brings something unique to the writing. Characters are distinguished not only by their dialogue but by the lens through which they view the events of the story. This gives a multidimensional view of the narrator characters -- when viewing or listening to one narrator from the point of view of the other, you learn something about each of them.

Notably, Bayaz, one of the most significant and ever-present characters, is never a narrator. It gives him a sense of otherness and mystique. His motivations are never fully clear. This would be a nice setup for a surprise chapter which is narrated by him. A similar device was used in [[Infinite Jest]]. The entire book is narrated in third-person when suddenly it shifts to first-person for a chapter. It’s disorienting and powerful.
