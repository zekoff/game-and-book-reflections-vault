Read at Emma Cate's request. I genuinely enjoyed reading it despite knowing it’s a novel written for youths. Something that would have gone over my head as a child was the parents. Jess’s father loses his job and seeing the strain it puts on him and his family and feeling it so keenly myself. Seeing his quiet distaste for Leslie most of the novel and then his tenderness towards Jess at the end while processing his grief. Watching Jess and Leslie truly believe in Terabithia. And a neat touch how Leslie was influenced by her hippie and well-read parents and how that imagination and sense of fantasy and bright color was what truly brought Terabithia to life for the children.
