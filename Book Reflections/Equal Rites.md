Supposedly the third Discworld novel (at least, according to the Amazon Kindle auto-select feature for which book to buy next in a series). Certainly and self-evidently set on the Discworld as with the first two books, but follows a different cast of characters so far. Seems to stand on its merits as a story so far, more than as a satire or fantasy deconstruction. Has a dry humor about it, but very little that’s outright funny. Follows a female wizard and introduces witches. Hinges on women’s magic versus men’s magic. Has a few echoes of Earthsea in the way that wizards are celibate, and that magic operates by tipping the balance with a finger on either side of a fulcrum.
