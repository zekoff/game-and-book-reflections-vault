Earthsea book #3. This is still in consideration as one of the best series I’ve read. The magic is changing a little since Book #1. It’s taking on firmer shape as the world is explored, although it’s still been worthwhile reading (in contrast to [[Dune]], for example). I have enjoyed reading to see more of the author’s perspective and how they’ll tell the story. I do plan to continue the series after this book as well (if there are others). But the first one is still my favorite because it leaves enough open to the imagination.
