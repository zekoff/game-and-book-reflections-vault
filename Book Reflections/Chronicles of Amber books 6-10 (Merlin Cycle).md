"Merlin Cycle" of the Amber books.

[[Trumps of Doom]]
[[Blood of Amber]]
[[Sign of Chaos]]
[[War of Jewels]]
[[Prince of Chaos]]

Merlin is distinctly different from Corwin and it actually makes Corwin stand out more in hindsight. There’s a neat moment I just encountered where Merlin finds Grayswandir (Corwin’s sword) mysteriously placed in Corwin’s chambers. It carries real gravitas.

The way sorcery works is neat. The sorcerers spend time preparing their spells by “hanging” them, to be discharged later by words and motions. The more effective a sorcerer is the better that they can hang the spells.

Also neat to have the Logrus added -- the Chaos equivalent of the Pattern. Where the pattern is all curves, the Logrus is all lines and angles. And it gives a different set of powers, for example the ability to reach into faraway shadows and retrieve things.
  
Final resolution was reasonably satisfying. There were a lot of twists and turns in this arc and not all of them seemed to matter. Luke was an extremely important character until he wasn’t. Corwin was absent for reasons that don’t seem beneficial to the story. Upon reflection, each book has a sensible arc on its own, but the overall arc was disjointed. One thing did not naturally lead to the next. In comparison to the first arc, where the five books could very well have all been one tome cover-to-cover.
