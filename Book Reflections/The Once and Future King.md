Broadly the arc is: the strong take what they will and the weak suffer what they must, then Arthur attempts to move towards the rule of law by channeling might via the Round Table. This fails when there are no more brigands left, so Arthur sends knights on the Grail Quest to prolong the channeling of old school might. This also fails and finally Arthur institutes the full rule of law, to which he, Lancelot, and Guenever fall prey. Merlyn actually does not feature as prominently as my memory. Also the conceit of Merlyn is that he lives time in reverse (thus, one meaning of “the once and future king”). I wonder if there is another meaning, that the once and future king is the rule of law, or maybe the rule of might? I was struck this reading by how Arthur ultimately finds that the rule of law leads to misery just as the rule of might did. It is existential.

I will never forget finishing my first reading of this book on a plane. I was neutral on the book for its entire duration and then on the last page I suddenly broke down crying as I considered Arthur's tragic and wholesome figure.
