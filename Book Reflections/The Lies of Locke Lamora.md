Best book I've read so far this year. Packs more excitement and plot into the book than the entire wheel of time series has after five books. Also well structured. The interludes keep characters developing without slowing the main plot. World building is thorough but not over indulgent. Gory and scatological at times which normally disgusts me, but the characters are so compelling that it is worth it. The stakes escalate the whole time without making what came before meaningless.
