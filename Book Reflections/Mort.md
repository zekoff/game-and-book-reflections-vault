Excellent book in its own right. It benefits from being set in the Discworld which has now been established by this time of book #4, but I don’t think it depends on that. This could probably be read as an imaginative standalone book. Ysabell and Death recur from previous books, and the appearance of Rincewind is basically an Easter egg, but even the unusual properties of the Discworld are only thematic additives to the story, rather than required prior reading. Mort is the earnest farmboy type, at first loveable in a “bless his heart” way, but that very earnestness makes him compelling and serves as a dramatic foil for his duel with Death. Death becomes a compelling character in his own right. The book gently explores the existential dread of immortality, and offers humor without undercutting itself. Like the final battle of [[The Light Fantastic]], the duel between Mort and Death is gripping and weighty, despite the book being unselfconscious about itself during most of the runtime.

All in all, an impressive read, and I’d be curious to know if it’s a good jumping-in point for someone unfamiliar with Discworld.
