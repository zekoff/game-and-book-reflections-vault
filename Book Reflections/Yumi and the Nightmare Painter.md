Enjoyable. Had a moment where I teared up, when Nikaro’s lies are revealed to Yumi, and Yumi decides to say something forgiving and encouraging even when she wasn’t sure she felt it. The narrator, voiced by Hoid, says something along the lines of “pay attention -- sometimes, this is what true heroism looks like.” And indeed, Nikaro urged along to redemption by it. Not necessarily redeemed in the active sense, as it was merely an encouragement on his journey.

Fun worldbuilding of how the nightmare world is not really parallel with the physical world, but in fact the physical world is shrouded in nightmare. They don’t co-exist, because only one of them occupies the space at any place. I liked how the technological advancement was the planet’s undoing. The gradual reveal of what was going on didn’t come off as a twist so much as an increasing understanding of what was happened. I think that was because the book didn’t spend a lot of time foreshadowing, and the reveal of the world’s true nature didn’t strongly recontextualize everything that happened before. If anything it was more shades of The Truman Show -- the characters in the world perceived it as a big reveal, but the reader has been told at various points that an explanation will be coming eventually, so it avoids the power (for better and worse) of a twist reveal.

Hoid’s narration wasn’t as grating as it eventually became in [[Tress of the Emerald Sea]]. He was a little more in check, and had a voice that was definitely his own but felt less outright condescending or worldly.
