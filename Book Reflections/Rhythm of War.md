Kaladin is depressed. Navani has impostor syndrome. I get it.

I do appreciate that at the very end Kaladin has overcome his demons. The book is careful to tell you they haven’t disappeared but he is no longer ruled by them.

In hindsight the book is pretty slow. Extremely long compared to what actually happened in it. I’m trying to think back now on how there was so much filler. The book spends a lot of time inside each character’s head telling us what they’re thinking instead of what they’re doing. The balance is too far on that side for my taste.

Fast-forward: at Christmas this year I received a printed copy of this book as a gift. I hadn’t realized how large it is. It dwarfs the entire six-volume [[The Lord of the Rings]]. This one book. Not the entire Stormlight archives is larger -- this one book is larger than the entire Lord of the Rings.
