Schreier’s books are most fun when they are simple works of investigative journalism. It’s clear that his years in the industry have given him a solid Rolodex and that he isn’t shy about pulling from it. Occasionally he’ll throw in a joke. Typically they’re on the nose, but they bring a dad-joke energy and show that he’s “one of us”, and so I appreciate them. This is the second book now where I’ve found Schreier to be heavy-handed with his views of the industry. I still think this is his right and I believe in his mind he’s a force of good. However, it does call his impartiality into question when considering if he’s telling the story exactly as it is.

I’m not sure where I land on whether a journalist should be impartial. Certainly we all bring ourselves to any endeavor. And finding the midpoint for a balanced view is itself subjective. Indeed, balance may not be universally the right thing: when faced perspectives that are moderate on one end and extreme on the other, the true representation of balance is not to split the difference, but to report the moderate position as it is. I suspect that Schreier considers himself in the legacy of muckrakers. There’s a need for that, too.

All that said, I find his positions to be generally just another crest in the wave of public opinion.
