Bobiverse #4. Feels like a soft reset for the series. Builds on the foundation of the initial trilogy so far, but feels like what the Bobiverse would have been if it continued on its initial course from Book #1, where instead it ended up being accidentally militaristic.

I’ve noticed, especially in this book, something that makes the world and story feel genuine -- the characters muse about what might have been, and they entertain alternate paths that the story doesn’t end up going down. Sometimes these end up being used later because they prefigured some other story element, and sometimes they go nowhere and are just used for flavor. My recent counterexample for this is the [[The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August]], where the character never really entertains anything that’s not on the story’s critical path. And the story’s critical path feels like the author is poking into the universe and railroading it to end up where the author wants it to go, not where the story naturally goes. The Bobiverse trilogy almost went too far in the other direction, where the author followed the story, even when it didn’t necessarily end up where it seems like it might have based on the first book. Here in this fourth book, this “soft reboot” of the Bobiverse, it feels like the author has found the middle road.
