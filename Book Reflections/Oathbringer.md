Adolin is a refreshing character. His good nature shines through clearly. How is this accomplished? His sense of humor is remarked on more than once. He gives and takes jibes in equal measure. They’re never delivered with bite or sarcasm. He appears to assume the best in people -- perhaps because he’s surprised when someone he is on friendly terms with betrays him. He’s not one-note in that way, or blind to the faults of others. He distrusts people worthy of distrust.

Maybe this is also accomplished by the way he’s always working towards something, instead of fleeing away from something. He wants to win Shards or protect Shallan or do his duty to his father or rescue besieged Kholinar. This is a pretty stark contrast to many other characters. Most everyone else is stuck in their past, hiding from someone, regretting past actions, vocally in pain, or a dozen other complications. The complications are part of making those characters fully featured in their own way. But Adolin is a breath of fresh air in that context.

He’s not necessarily my favorite character. But he’s likeable yet fully featured. Not a buffoon who exists only as a foil to other characters.
